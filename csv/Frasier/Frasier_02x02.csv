14.75,15.96,Martin,What the hell are you doing?
16.14,17.41,Daphne,Ironing your son's socks.
17.69,20.07,Martin,Why don't you just twist them into little balls like you do mine?
21.05,22.86,Daphne,He says it bruises the cashmere.
23.58,27.49,Daphne,"He likes them pressed, folded, they're neatly arranged in those sock dividers."
28.17,32.22,Daphne,"I saw them in a catalog once, but couldn't you imagine who in the world would ever buy such silly things?"
34.13,35.53,Daphne,Of course I haven't met Dr. Crane yet.
37.35,39.72,Martin,I used to think they'd been some sort of mix-up at the hospital.
40.10,42.87,Martin,"Of course, when Niles came along, he shot that theory all to hell."
46.23,47.73,Frasier,"Oh, Dad. Dad, please."
48.07,50.22,Frasier,"Coaster, your beer is sweating."
50.66,53.03,Martin,So am I. Do you want to shove one of those under my can?
59.07,59.83,Daphne,"If he could, he would."
63.79,65.35,Frasier,"Oh, Mrs. Greenway, what a pleasant surprise."
65.35,66.47,Dorathea,I knew it. That's him.
66.92,67.58,Frasier,Won't you come in?
68.44,71.39,Dorathea,"I had to see him again before I was sure, but now I'm positive."
71.81,75.88,Dorathea,That is the horny little mixed breed who got my Phoebe pregnant.
78.57,80.66,Martin,"Hey, you can't just bust in here accusing my dog."
80.74,81.53,Dorathea,"Oh, it's him all right."
81.59,84.14,Dorathea,I had to keep shooing him away from Phoebe down at the park.
84.60,85.05,Dorathea,Look at him.
85.67,87.57,Dorathea,He doesn't care whose life he's ruined.
89.53,92.84,Dorathea,All he cares about is his own selfish pleasure.
94.80,96.09,Martin,"You know your problem is, Dorothy."
96.45,97.34,Martin,You got a bad attitude.
97.42,97.50,Dorathea,Oh.
98.36,99.93,Martin,That's why nobody sits with you in the park.
100.41,101.14,Martin,It's what you seek.
101.54,103.69,Frasier,"Mrs. Greenway, there's no way that Eddie could be the father."
103.78,104.50,Frasier,He's been neutered.
104.72,105.46,Dorathea,"Oh, really?"
106.11,107.85,Dorathea,"Well, then, how do you explain these?"
108.35,109.17,Frasier,"Oh, my God!"
114.23,115.27,Frasier,They're miniature Eddie's!
115.65,117.10,Dorathea,You're so adorable!
117.36,120.73,Dorathea,"Well, I'm glad you think so, because they're yours."
120.93,122.19,Frasier,"Oh, bad dog!"
122.94,123.74,Frasier,Look what you did!
125.57,126.25,Frasier,"Here, take these."
126.89,129.02,Frasier,"Dad? Dad, I expect an explanation."
129.52,131.15,Frasier,"All this time, I thought Eddie had been fixed."
131.57,132.69,Martin,All you had to do was walk.
133.00,135.59,Frasier,"Oh, well, I'm glad to say I've never been that bored."
135.85,138.68,Daphne,"Oh, couldn't you just eat them all?"
138.68,140.93,Frasier,"Oh, for God's sake, please, don't-don't love them."
140.95,143.30,Frasier,They'll think they're staying and keep them off the couch.
144.20,146.27,Frasier,"Oh, were you thinking of letting him run free in the park?"
146.29,148.58,Frasier,Haven't you seen the way he tries to romance my towel warmer?
151.23,152.95,Martin,"Well, he's cooped up here all day."
153.01,154.42,Martin,"When we go to the park, I'll let him off the leash"
154.44,155.79,Martin,so he can get a little exercise.
155.79,157.53,Frasier,"Please, apparently, that's not all he got."
159.80,161.75,Daphne,I think I've found the perfect name for this woman.
161.75,162.23,Frasier,Stop!
163.44,166.57,Frasier,"Those only need names if you're planning to call them to you, which we're not."
167.37,171.84,Frasier,"Oh, now, listen, you get right back in there, you major little thing."
171.86,173.47,Frasier,"Come on, come on. All right."
173.47,175.07,Frasier,"All right, now, I've got to run down to the radio station,"
175.39,177.10,Frasier,"but believe me, we're gonna have a discussion about this when I get back."
177.10,179.97,Martin,"Oh, relax, Frasier. I'll have any taken care of tomorrow."
180.23,182.85,Frasier,"Yes, well, you better. Now, Daphne, give me that box, please."
183.47,184.72,Daphne,Where are you taking the puppies?
185.04,187.45,Frasier,To see if I can unload some of them down at the station.
187.85,190.03,Daphne,"Oh, well, couldn't we just keep them for a while?"
190.09,192.28,Frasier,"No, we don't want them taking after their father."
193.87,194.85,Frasier,Maybe too late already.
195.37,197.19,Frasier,"Oh, for God's sake."
197.90,199.51,Frasier,Stop staring at me!
205.33,207.51,Frasier,"Hello, Roz. Don't you look lovely."
207.51,209.10,Roz,"I know what's in the box, and I don't want one."
209.20,210.36,Frasier,But I didn't say anything.
211.67,213.13,Roz,Betty from accounting called to warn me.
213.19,214.58,Roz,"Where did you find them, anyway?"
214.74,215.62,Frasier,In my living room.
216.54,219.43,Frasier,These are Eddie's mongrel seed.
221.69,223.59,Frasier,"You don't know anybody that wants six puppies, do you?"
223.65,225.34,Roz,"Six? All right, Eddie."
225.46,226.12,Frasier,"Oh, please."
227.50,229.53,Frasier,I've been traipsing up and down the hallway
229.59,230.97,Frasier,for an hour trying to unload them.
231.00,232.60,Frasier,I haven't had the slightest bit of luck.
232.80,235.13,Roz,"Well, Frasier, not everybody likes dogs."
235.53,237.03,Roz,Take me. I'm a cat person.
237.73,239.18,Roz,"I mean, it's not like I'd ever buy a cat mug"
239.24,240.62,Roz,"or a cat calendar or anything,"
240.74,242.37,Roz,but I had a cat when I was growing up.
243.03,244.05,Roz,We were almost inseparable.
244.61,246.82,Roz,"Muffles or Scruffles, something like that."
248.88,253.70,Frasier,"You know, Ross, it's entirely possible that there is a dog lover inside you that's just"
253.78,254.59,Frasier,dying to get out.
255.29,255.83,Frasier,Don't you think so?
255.91,256.81,Frasier,"Come on, come on."
257.64,258.56,Frasier,Just take a look.
259.06,259.37,Frasier,Come on.
259.45,260.94,Frasier,Take away the look.
261.12,261.97,Frasier,"Come on, look."
264.44,265.63,Roz,He's adorable.
266.25,268.07,Roz,"Oh, come here, little fella."
268.25,268.86,Roz,"Oh, huh"
269.85,271.97,Roz,Aren't you the cutiest litte thing?
273.38,274.89,Roz,"Oh, yeah. Give me a kiss. Give me a kiss."
275.30,276.63,Roz,"Oh, I love you, too."
278.08,279.04,Roz,There. Happy now?
284.05,287.06,Frasier,"Ross, how can you just toss him aside"
287.07,288.83,Frasier,after such a tender display of affection?
289.23,290.33,Roz,"I can do it with men, too."
292.94,295.05,Roz,"Come on, Fraser. It's time to start the show."
295.24,296.74,Frasier,Phil! Puppy! Puppy!
298.99,299.75,Frasier,They're all onto me.
299.89,301.49,Frasier,"All right, now you guys behave yourselves."
304.92,309.56,Frasier,"Hello, Seattle. This is Dr. Frasier Crane, coming to you from KACL 780 Talk Radio."
309.92,314.11,Frasier,"I'll be with you for the next three hours. So, Roz, who's our first caller?"
314.44,317.46,Roz,We have Rita on Line 4. She's feeling a little overwhelmed at home.
319.02,320.85,Frasier,"Hello, Rita? I'm listening."
321.15,326.04,Rita,"Yeah, Dr. Crane? Oh, Dr. Crane, I'm, um, thank you for taking my call."
326.16,331.15,Rita,"I, I tell you, I, I, um, I'm about to lose my mind."
331.21,335.54,Rita,"I am raising four kids by myself. The oldest one is not even seven, and the"
335.72,341.60,Rita,other three are all under five. Between cooking and cleaning and changing diapers and tripping
341.65,347.96,Rita,"over toys, I feel sometimes like I am about to snap. What should I do?"
349.00,350.21,Frasier,Have you considered getting a puppy?
357.96,361.18,Thomas,"Well, if we can't have this one are there any other puppies available?"
361.64,365.45,Daphne,"No, we found homes for all the others, but thanks for coming over. Bye now."
365.83,367.48,Thomas,"But the children, I mean Dr. Crane said"
367.48,370.55,Daphne,"Well, don't you so wobbly. There are other dogs in the world, you know."
370.99,374.62,Daphne,Now give me that. Thank you for coming over. Thank you.
376.93,379.30,Frasier,Thought you might like some wine and pate.
379.56,381.71,Frasier,I made some lemonade for the children.
386.79,387.62,Frasier,Where are the Thomases?
388.48,389.88,Frasier,Why is that dog still here?
390.89,391.90,Daphne,"I'm sorry, Dr. Crane,"
391.94,393.87,Daphne,but they struck me as unfit guardians.
394.23,396.07,Frasier,"For God's sake, he works at the zoo."
397.85,399.45,Frasier,"She's a nurse, Billy's an altar boy,"
399.48,401.27,Frasier,and Kathy is a campfire girl.
401.49,402.66,Daphne,They had a dark aura.
402.98,404.59,Frasier,They had a ten-acre farm.
404.63,406.08,Frasier,"If they'd have taken me, I'd have gone with them."
406.94,408.84,Daphne,"Ah, I see."
409.30,410.80,Daphne,So you want me to give the little fellow away
410.86,411.63,Daphne,to just anybody?
411.81,413.90,Frasier,"Well, no, I'm not saying that."
413.90,415.51,Frasier,It's just that he can't stay here.
418.98,420.38,Frasier,"Oh, hello, Niles. Come on in."
421.12,422.31,Niles,"Hope you don't mind my stopping by,"
422.37,425.16,Niles,but Maris is hosting the women's league senior yoga group
425.22,427.41,Niles,"and, well, old money and body stockings."
432.83,434.94,Frasier,"Say no more, you're welcome to hide out here."
436.07,438.19,Niles,I see the kennel is still open.
438.96,443.73,Frasier,"Yes, but that's the last one I'd even managed to find a nice home for him but Daphne"
443.89,446.32,Frasier,thought the family wasn't nice enough. Some pate Niles?
446.32,447.61,Daphne,I didn't reject them.
447.80,452.55,Daphne,The dog did. Canines have a very keen sense of who's a nice person and who isn't
453.17,458.22,Daphne,"Why, many's the time I've chosen a man based solely on the way my mum's springer spaniel took to him."
458.68,462.13,Frasier,"Oh, Daffy, that is preposterous, letting a dog choose your dates."
463.27,467.80,Daphne,"It's true. If a dog likes a man, it's a good bet he's warm and sensitive."
467.96,469.95,Niles,"You know, I really didn't get a good look at this little tyke."
474.59,477.33,Niles,"Come here, boy. Come to your Uncle Niles here."
484.00,486.53,Daphne,Look at that. He's taken quite a shine to you.
486.55,487.64,Niles,"Yeah, it happens all the time."
491.87,494.04,Frasier,"Daphne, would you mind taking the dog away, please?"
494.03,496.55,Frasier,Get back on the phone with the Thomases and tell them we reconsidered.
496.77,499.66,Daphne,"Oh, all right, but only for a two-week trial."
500.02,500.28,Frasier,Thank you.
500.28,501.55,Daphne,"Come along, Basil."
501.85,503.01,Frasier,I told you not to name them.
505.48,506.72,Niles,"Oh, hello, Dad."
506.55,507.07,Frasier,Hi dad.
507.49,508.37,Martin,"Afternoon, boys."
514.91,519.42,Frasier,"Dad, I seem to remember that Eddie had a little appointment down at the vet's."
520.24,524.22,Frasier,Can't help but notice he still has that certain spring in his step.
528.47,531.18,Martin,"Yeah, well, we started heading down there."
532.15,533.79,Martin,"but the traffic was a bear, you know."
534.11,537.52,Martin,You get a sunny day in this town and everybody forgets how to drive.
540.34,541.87,Frasier,"You are going to reschedule, aren't you?"
541.86,543.88,Martin,"Oh, yeah, yeah. I'll call in the morning."
544.32,546.48,Frasier,This is the second time you've canceled that appointment.
546.91,548.11,Frasier,What seems to be the problem?
548.38,550.57,Martin,It's no problem. You lost the big deal.
550.57,552.44,Martin,"I'll call tomorrow. Relax, will ya?"
552.91,553.46,Niles,Oh.
554.12,555.65,Niles,"Dear God, he's licking me."
555.82,556.36,Frasier,"Oh, Eddie."
557.35,558.51,Frasier,"Eddie, just stop."
561.27,561.87,Frasier,"Oh, Niles."
563.63,565.46,Frasier,You have liver behind your ears.
568.15,570.15,Niles,Imagine I must have picked up a cracker and inadvertently
570.19,571.08,Niles,scratched behind my ear.
573.00,574.00,Frasier,So you're telling me that you had
574.04,577.31,Frasier,a wad of cold meat behind your ears and you didn't feel it?
578.91,580.39,Niles,"That's the story I'm sticking with, yes."
585.54,588.04,Frasier,"Dad, dad, listen. I want your assurance that you'll take care of this."
588.19,588.61,Martin,Fine.
588.61,589.29,Frasier,You promise?
589.39,593.08,Martin,"Hey, I said I'd do it and I will. You don't have to pin a note to my sweater. Get off my back."
593.64,595.41,Martin,"Anybody wants me, I'll be down at Duke's."
597.13,598.99,Niles,Ever notice how much faster he moves when he's wrong?
600.46,603.70,Frasier,Apparently he's got some sort of psychological block against taking Eddie down there.
603.92,606.79,Frasier,Guess I'm gonna have to do it. Somebody has to be responsible in this family.
606.93,608.33,Frasier,"All right, good boy, Eddie, come on, let's go."
609.16,609.38,Niles,Eddie.
612.51,612.99,Frasier,"Ah, Niles."
614.17,616.86,Niles,"Oh, now Eddie, it's a routine operation."
617.56,620.23,Niles,"They say it's almost painless, although I can't imagine."
625.19,626.47,Frasier,"You know, Niles, perhaps it's best"
626.51,628.39,Frasier,we don't discuss the operation.
629.18,629.96,Frasier,We might spook him.
631.17,633.29,Niles,"Excuse me, are you saying he understands me?"
635.12,638.20,Frasier,"Well, he understands the word B-A-T-H."
639.02,640.31,Frasier,God knows how much English he's picked up.
642.46,642.78,Niles,Fine.
643.28,644.42,Niles,Tu tournes a droit.
644.96,645.65,Niles,"Ah, bon bon."
646.37,647.83,Frasier,Je marcherai derriere lui..
648.37,651.27,Niles,"Mais, tu es celui qui va l'amener chez le medecin pour le... snip-snip."
651.77,651.95,Frasier,Ah?
653.07,653.56,Frasier,C'est vrai.
654.40,655.41,Frasier,"Oh, what are we doing?"
655.67,656.27,Frasier,"Eddie, come here."
656.38,657.02,Frasier,This is ridiculous.
657.20,658.51,Frasier,"Oh, oh, look at him."
659.01,659.78,Frasier,"Oh, what a insane..."
659.86,661.09,Frasier,"I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go."
677.72,679.41,Frasier,What are you staring at?
682.41,683.39,Frasier,"You know why you're here, don't you?"
685.79,687.58,Frasier,"Well, now, listen, it's-it's for your own good."
687.66,689.57,Frasier,"Believe me, you'll-you'll be much happier afterwards."
694.65,696.12,Frasier,"Look, your-your day-to-day routine,"
696.12,697.93,Frasier,it-it'll be exactly the same.
698.75,699.65,Frasier,"You'll be able to sleep,"
700.41,701.54,Frasier,"run around with your little buddies,"
701.66,703.15,Frasier,"and go play in the woods,"
703.17,705.13,Frasier,"and chase the birds, lick your..."
710.57,711.39,Frasier,Did I mention sleep?
713.55,714.84,Martin,"You got a lot of nerve, you know that?"
715.22,715.83,Martin,"You all right, boy?"
715.95,717.63,Frasier,"Well, of course he's all right, Dad."
717.63,718.67,Frasier,Why are you so upset?
718.70,719.80,Frasier,I'm only doing this to help you out.
719.95,721.27,Martin,"Oh, that's a load of crap."
721.63,723.50,Frasier,"Look, we agreed that this had to be done, right?"
723.94,725.93,Frasier,"Now, you seem to have a problem with it, so I took charge."
725.97,727.30,Martin,"Well, I don't need you taking charge."
727.36,729.35,Martin,"Eddie's my dog, so mind your own damn business."
729.67,730.75,Martin,And here's something else you should know.
731.05,732.54,Martin,"I don't need your help, and I don't want it."
732.82,733.81,Frasier,Why are you so upset?
733.83,735.17,Frasier,It doesn't matter who brought him down on you.
735.19,735.86,Martin,"Oh, yes, it does."
735.88,737.53,Martin,"I'm perfectly capable of taking care of it,"
737.55,739.45,Martin,"just like I feed him, walk him, and give him his back."
740.07,740.27,Martin,Eddie!
741.16,743.13,Martin,See what you did. Me!
745.41,746.35,Martin,"Yeah, okay, thanks."
746.85,749.48,Martin,"Oh, and listen, uh, Daphne's here in case anybody sees him."
751.48,753.81,Martin,I got the guys at the station circulating Eddie's picture.
754.15,755.60,Martin,I'm gonna go out and look for him some more.
755.84,757.51,Daphne,"Oh, come on, now. You've done enough."
757.65,759.29,Daphne,Why don't you just sit still and drink your tea?
759.86,760.54,Martin,I hate tea.
760.94,763.41,Daphne,"Humor me. In an emergency, it's all I know how to do."
763.87,766.05,Martin,"That's a real comfort, coming from a health care provider."
775.01,775.67,Frasier,"Dad, I'm sorry."
776.71,777.79,Frasier,There was no luck at the pound.
779.42,781.30,Frasier,They said they'd call if they find a dog
781.38,782.38,Frasier,matching Eddie's description.
784.62,787.00,Frasier,A $500 reward for Eddie?
789.39,790.47,Frasier,Are you sure it's enough?
794.37,796.80,Martin,"Right now, it's about 500 more than I'd pay to get you back."
799.88,800.73,Frasier,"Look, Dad, I said I was sorry."
801.99,804.36,Martin,"Well, I just can't sit here. I'm going back to the park."
804.64,807.36,Frasier,The park again? What makes you think he's gonna show up there?
807.50,808.70,Martin,Because that's his hangout.
808.96,810.34,Martin,"Didn't you ever have a place like that,"
810.42,812.83,Martin,"somewhere where you went to meet women, a place where you got lucky?"
815.78,817.07,Frasier,"Well, I suppose so, yeah."
817.25,818.09,Martin,Didn't you go back?
820.52,821.07,Frasier,To the park!
822.71,824.55,Martin,This time we'll comb every inch of that place.
824.59,826.28,Martin,"Every tree, every bush."
826.34,828.69,Martin,"Uh, uh, uh, Daphne, uh, we're gonna need more help."
828.75,830.79,Martin,So call Niles and tell him we'll pick him up.
830.91,832.40,Frasier,"Oh, yes. Wouldn't want to go out into the wild"
832.44,834.20,Frasier,without one of the world's great outdoorsmen.
836.17,837.81,Daphne,"Oh, uh, this is odd."
838.49,840.99,Daphne,I just got one of my psychic flashes. It's about Eddie.
841.16,841.82,Martin,Well?
842.05,848.01,Daphne,It doesn't make any sense all I'm getting is a picture of Eddie sitting with Dr. Crane
857.68,858.66,Martin,Any luck?
859.22,860.22,Frasier,I couldn't find him.
860.37,861.37,Martin,Where is Niles?
861.56,863.49,Frasier,"Ah, we split up to cover more ground."
865.72,868.95,Martin,"Well, scrunch down! If Eddie comes back and sees you here, he'll run away again."
879.47,883.14,Frasier,"You know, Dad, maybe we ought to call it a night you've been sitting in this car for three hours."
883.24,887.31,Martin,"Oh, that's nothing. I was on a stakeout once for 15 hours without ever getting out of the car."
887.97,891.82,Martin,We had a contest so you could last the longest. The winner was Canteen McHugh.
892.74,893.89,Martin,You know why we called him that?
894.71,895.61,Frasier,I think I can guess.
896.01,899.70,Martin,Because his bladder was the size of a canteen.
899.94,901.21,Frasier,Thank you for clearing that up.
902.01,903.70,Martin,You could have slung his bladder over your shoulder
903.74,906.03,Martin,and gone on a 20-mile force march through the desert.
907.17,907.59,Frasier,Big huh?
908.20,909.18,Martin,Isn't that what I've been saying?
913.75,915.60,Martin,"Hey, close that window. It's freezing."
915.72,917.49,Frasier,"Oh, Dad, it's like a blast furnace in here."
917.59,919.67,Martin,"Well, I'm cold, okay? At my age, you get cold easily."
919.94,920.47,Frasier,Right.
923.92,928.29,Frasier,"You know, Dad, I've just developed a very interesting theory about you."
929.72,931.74,Martin,"If I begged you, would you share it with me?"
936.23,937.71,Frasier,That's your attitude. Just forget it.
943.61,943.79,Frasier,Hello?
944.85,945.29,Frasier,"Oh, Niles!"
946.34,946.92,Martin,Did he find him?
947.12,950.23,Frasier,"Just a second. Niles, let me put you on speaker phone here. Hang on."
951.39,952.74,Frasier,"Okay, go ahead, Niles."
953.13,954.88,Niles,"I'm out here in the middle of the park, and I'm lost."
960.99,962.85,Niles,Thank God for my cellular.
962.86,963.86,Martin,Did you see Eddie?
964.48,969.97,Niles,"No, but I thought I saw a raccoon. When I stopped running, I had no idea where I was."
971.86,972.86,Niles,You've got to help me.
972.89,976.90,Frasier,"All right, all right, Niles, just remain calm. Let me think back to my boys"
976.90,984.46,Frasier,scout training all right now uh we're on the northeast corner of the park all right look
984.56,990.91,Frasier,into the heavens and see if you can spot the north star then you want to turn 12 degrees to your right.
990.66,993.34,Martin,"Oh, for God's sake, just walk towards the horn"
1002.48,1004.62,Niles,"I hear it. I hear it, Dad. I-I'm walking."
1004.87,1006.63,Martin,"All right, just keep following it."
1008.35,1011.14,Niles,"I-I see a grove of trees and a fountain,"
1011.44,1014.23,Niles,"and a horrible, wretched, hunchbacked old man."
1014.37,1014.99,Niles,Stay away from me!
1016.48,1019.05,Niles,"No, no, it's just a bush."
1023.34,1025.20,Niles,"Okay, okay, things are beginning to look familiar now."
1025.56,1025.98,Niles,Keep honking.
1028.77,1029.57,Niles,I think I'm homing in.
1030.13,1031.58,Niles,"Yes, I'm quite sure this is the way."
1035.50,1036.34,Niles,"Okay, you can hang up now."
1039.27,1041.27,Niles,That was a harrowing experience.
1041.43,1044.48,Martin,"Yeah, shrubbing a raccoon in one night and you live to tell about it."
1045.82,1047.95,Niles,"Dad, I'm sorry I couldn't find Eddie."
1049.77,1052.38,Niles,"I hope you understand, I think I'd like to go home now"
1052.46,1055.23,Niles,"and hold my wife, that is, if she'll let me."
1056.81,1057.78,Niles,I'll just peel the cab.
1058.32,1059.92,Frasier,Be sure to call us from the curb when you get there
1059.98,1060.82,Frasier,so we know you're safe.
1070.07,1071.33,Martin,"Hey, you're probably tired too."
1071.47,1072.91,Martin,"If you wanna go with him, that's okay."
1073.10,1075.15,Frasier,"No, it's all right, Dad. I'll stay for a while longer."
1082.99,1085.39,Martin,"Look, I'm sorry I cut you off like that before."
1085.67,1088.92,Martin,I've just never gone in for that psychological mumbo-jumbo.
1089.72,1092.77,Martin,Probably started back on the force when they'd make us go see the squirrel.
1093.99,1094.07,Frasier,Who?
1095.15,1096.82,Martin,"Dr. Bergman, the department shrink."
1097.54,1100.37,Martin,We nicknamed him the squirrel because guys got sent to him when they got squirrelly.
1101.19,1104.48,Martin,He'd show you a bunch of ink blots and ask you about your toilet habits.
1105.00,1106.39,Martin,"If we wanted to talk about toilet habits,"
1106.39,1108.05,Martin,I would have stayed partners with Nate Dombrowski.
1108.65,1109.74,Martin,We nicknamed him the big...
1109.78,1110.20,Frasier,Thank you.
1117.81,1119.69,Martin,"Look, it wasn't just Eddie I was mad about."
1121.27,1123.20,Martin,Eddie was the straw that broke the camel's back.
1124.50,1128.11,Martin,"Seems like I'm always being told to take my feet off the furniture,"
1128.23,1129.56,Martin,"put a coaster under my beer,"
1130.58,1131.65,Martin,Turn the TV down.
1134.09,1136.03,Martin,I used to make the rules and now I have to follow them.
1137.53,1138.76,Martin,Is this making any sense to you?
1139.26,1140.73,Frasier,"Well, from a psychological standpoint,"
1140.73,1141.63,Frasier,it makes perfect sense.
1142.93,1143.86,Frasier,"Slowly, over the years,"
1143.96,1146.11,Frasier,your responsibilities have been taken away from you
1146.19,1150.80,Frasier,"and you, well, you feel symbolically castrated."
1151.44,1152.89,Martin,"Oh, why does everything with you shrink"
1152.99,1154.01,Martin,start in the crotch?
1156.11,1157.21,Frasier,"All right, all right."
1157.21,1157.57,Frasier,Hmm.
1159.11,1161.79,Frasier,"Well, maybe my rules are too rigid."
1162.03,1163.86,Frasier,Maybe I should try to relax a little.
1163.98,1164.06,Martin,No.
1164.14,1164.58,Martin,"No, no, no."
1165.73,1166.35,Martin,It's your house.
1166.41,1167.15,Martin,You do what you want.
1169.22,1170.21,Martin,I don't know what's bugging me.
1172.94,1176.80,Martin,Guess it's not easy for a guy like me to not be in charge.
1180.57,1182.75,Frasier,"You know, Dad, a lot of people confuse not being in charge"
1182.81,1183.93,Frasier,with not being respected.
1185.94,1188.80,Frasier,"I hope you're not making that mistake,"
1190.55,1192.81,Frasier,because you command a great deal of respect.
1194.21,1196.78,Frasier,There's not a day in my life when I don't hold myself up
1196.80,1198.10,Frasier,to the Martin Crane yardstick.
1199.97,1203.06,Frasier,I guess the son always wants to make his father proud.
1206.11,1206.69,Martin,"Yeah, I guess."
1210.09,1210.19,Frasier,So?
1213.70,1215.08,Martin,"Yeah, yeah, you're doing fine."
1216.39,1217.75,Martin,Even if you are a big pain in the ass.
1222.51,1226.06,Frasier,"You know, I don't know if I could have made Eddie go through with that operation anyway."
1227.94,1229.80,Frasier,That's a tough thing for a guy to do to another guy.
1231.64,1232.56,Martin,Amen to that.
1239.61,1245.57,Frasier,You know what? It's getting kind of late. What do you say we go home get some sleep.
1248.40,1250.36,Martin,"Hey, hey, come here, boy."
1252.86,1254.36,Martin,"Hey, attaboy."
1254.75,1256.77,Martin,"Hey, good to see you, fella."
1256.77,1258.25,Martin,How you doing?
1258.25,1260.55,Martin,It might be nice if you welcomed him back.
1260.98,1262.07,Frasier,"Hello, Eddie. Good dog."
1262.07,1262.91,Frasier,"Oh, wet dog."
1263.21,1265.11,Martin,"Yeah, you're shivering here."
1265.50,1267.05,Martin,We got to get you warmed up.
1267.42,1269.46,Frasier,"Dad, that's 100% casmere pullover."
1271.10,1272.70,Frasier,It's meant to be worn with the collar up.
