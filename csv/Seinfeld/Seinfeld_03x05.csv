1.98,5.24,Jerry,Does it seem to you that the ventriloquist dummy
6.19,9.22,Jerry,"has a very active, sexual, social life?"
10.25,15.58,Jerry,He's always talking about dates and women that he knows and bringing them back to the suitcase at night.
15.77,21.66,Jerry,"There's always a sawdust joke in there somewhere, you know, kinky things because he's made out"
21.70,23.77,Jerry,of wood and he can spin his head around.
24.35,30.70,Jerry,"We're somehow expected to believe, because the face is so animated, that they think we're"
30.72,33.01,Jerry,not noticing that the feet are just swinging there.
33.27,35.17,Jerry,"Dummy feet never look really right, do they?"
35.17,39.48,Jerry,"They're just kind of dangling there, always kind of askew, you know, and you always just"
39.52,43.05,Jerry,"see little ankle, those little thin fabric ankles that they have, you know."
43.59,45.66,Jerry,"You think, I don't think this thing is real."
49.79,50.57,Jerry,Are you kidding me?
51.89,53.35,Jerry,Let me speak with the head librarian.
54.38,55.40,Jerry,Because it's absurd!
56.60,59.55,Jerry,An overdue book from 1971?
60.40,61.44,Jerry,"This is a joke, right?"
61.44,62.71,Jerry,"What are you, from a radio station?"
63.47,64.56,Jerry,"Okay, you got me."
64.72,65.70,Jerry,I fell for it.
67.41,68.49,Jerry,"All right, okay."
69.01,70.64,Jerry,"I can be down there in like a half hour,"
71.06,71.66,Jerry,Bye.
72.92,73.57,Kramer,What's the problem?
74.32,75.13,Jerry,This you're not gonna believe.
74.96,75.67,Kramer,Go.
75.31,77.03,Jerry,The New York Public Library
77.03,77.69,Kramer,Uh-huh.
77.84,81.82,Jerry,says that I took out Tropic of Cancer in 1971.
82.59,83.43,Jerry,And never returned it.
84.40,86.22,Kramer,Do you know how much that comes to?
87.03,88.98,Kramer,That's a nickel a day for 20 years.
89.28,90.79,Kramer,"It's gonna be $50,000."
90.99,92.28,Jerry,It doesn't work like that.
91.99,93.70,Kramer,"If it's a dime a day, it could be $100,000."
94.33,95.53,Jerry,It's not gonna be anything.
95.82,96.83,Jerry,I returned the book.
97.02,98.02,Jerry,I remember it very vividly
98.46,99.78,Jerry,because I was with Sherry Becker.
100.60,101.76,Jerry,She wore this orange dress.
101.76,103.63,Jerry,It's the first time I ever saw in a dress like that.
104.06,105.02,Jerry,"I'd known her since ninth grade,"
105.03,107.00,Jerry,and she was developing this body in secret
107.19,108.94,Jerry,"under these loose clothes for, like, two years."
109.70,110.67,Jerry,"And then one day,"
112.03,116.12,Jerry,"this orange dress, it's burned in my memory."
116.56,118.03,Kramer,"Ooh, memory burn, huh?"
119.36,120.73,Jerry,I wonder what happened to her.
120.73,121.58,Kramer,How did they find you?
122.16,123.36,Jerry,"Oh, computers."
123.40,125.53,Jerry,They're cracking down now on overdue books.
125.81,127.23,Jerry,The whole thing is completely ridiculous.
129.08,129.48,Jerry,It's George.
129.54,131.63,Jerry,"When he finds out we're going to the library, he'll be thrilled."
132.79,134.21,Kramer,You know I never got a library card?
134.37,135.12,Jerry,I'm coming down.
136.14,138.14,Kramer,It's all a bunch of cheapskates in there anyway.
138.70,142.35,Kramer,people sitting around reading the newspaper attached to those huge wooden sticks
143.36,144.47,Kramer,trying to save a quarter.
145.98,147.49,Jerry,"Look, I gotta go to the library. You wanna go?"
148.50,149.08,Kramer,Yeah.
158.91,160.52,Kramer,The Dewey Decimal System.
160.52,162.00,Kramer,What a scam that was.
163.36,166.13,Kramer,"Boy, this Dewey guy really cleaned up on that deal."
167.35,168.08,Jerry,Where's George?
168.64,169.25,Reader,Shhh.
170.16,171.77,Kramer,"Yeah, look. Trying to save a quarter."
172.85,173.84,Jerry,I kind of like those sticks.
173.88,174.92,Jerry,I like to get them in my house.
181.93,183.13,Jerry,This woman's completely ignoring me.
184.53,184.93,Kramer,Look at her.
185.97,188.30,Kramer,This is a lonely woman looking for companionship.
190.77,191.72,Kramer,A spinster.
193.01,193.74,Kramer,Maybe a virgin.
196.07,198.71,Kramer,Maybe she got hurt a long time ago.
199.30,202.24,Kramer,"She's a schoolgirl, there was a boy, it didn't work out."
202.97,204.52,Kramer,So now she needs a little tenderness.
205.32,206.57,Kramer,She needs a little understanding.
207.90,209.08,Kramer,"Needs a little Kramer, huh?"
213.00,214.57,Jerry,Then she'll need a little shot of penicillin.
217.52,218.11,Marion,Yes?
218.44,220.20,Jerry,"Yeah, I called before. I got this notice in the mail."
222.09,224.41,Marion,"Oh, Tropic of Cancer."
225.00,225.93,Marion,Henry Miller.
228.12,231.81,Marion,"Uh, this case has been turned over to our library investigations officer, Mr. Bookman."
232.24,236.46,Kramer,Bookman? The library investigator's name is actually Bookman?
237.72,238.09,Marion,It's true.
238.49,239.33,Kramer,That's amazing.
239.95,241.70,Kramer,That's like an ice cream man named Cone.
243.02,245.43,Marion,"Well, Lieutenant Bookman's been working here for 25 years,"
245.43,246.61,Marion,so I think he's heard all the jokes.
247.13,248.18,Jerry,Can I speak with this Bookman?
248.60,249.08,Marion,Just a second.
253.05,254.47,George,Jerry. Jerry.
255.81,256.08,Jerry,What?
257.62,258.29,George,I think I saw him.
259.23,259.75,George,I think it's him.
260.35,260.43,Jerry,Who?
261.19,263.02,George,Did you see the homeless guy on the library steps
263.40,265.91,George,screaming obscenities and doing some sort of calisthenics routine?
265.91,266.29,Kramer,Yeah.
265.92,266.29,Jerry,Yeah.
267.13,268.07,George,I think that's Mr. Hayman.
269.34,270.99,George,The gym teacher from our high school.
271.36,272.32,Reader,Shh.
274.21,275.15,Jerry,"Hayman, are you sure?"
275.63,278.66,George,"He's oldeer, completely covered in filth."
279.66,280.93,George,"No whistle, but I think it's him."
283.08,285.44,Jerry,George got him fired. He squealed on him.
285.52,286.44,Kramer,"Ooh, a tattle tale."
286.56,287.49,George,I didn't tattle.
290.03,291.89,Kramer,What did this guy do? What happened?
291.89,293.64,George,There was an incident I'd rather not discuss.
293.78,294.97,Kramer,"Oh, come on. You can tell me."
295.41,296.05,George,Some other time.
296.25,296.73,Kramer,"What, tonight?"
299.11,300.43,Kramer,"You know, I never figured you for a squealer."
300.71,302.16,Jerry,"Oh, he sang like a canary."
303.01,304.25,Marion,Mr. Bookman is not here.
304.47,306.29,Jerry,Not here? Why was I told to come down here?
306.55,308.18,Marion,He'll be out all afternoon on a case.
308.36,309.30,Kramer,He's out on a case?
309.73,311.21,Kramer,He actually goes out on cases.
312.33,313.38,Jerry,"Well, what am I supposed to do now?"
313.66,315.22,Marion,I'll have Mr. Bookman get in touch with you.
316.47,317.13,Jerry,"All right, thanks."
318.35,319.01,Jerry,"Come on, let's go."
319.25,320.16,George,Let's go see if it's Hayman.
320.32,321.06,George,That's not him.
321.34,323.50,Kramer,"Hey, I'll, uh, I'll see you boys later, huh?"
328.91,330.81,Kramer,"So, uh, what's a guy got to do around here"
330.81,331.77,Kramer,to get a library card.
343.55,343.99,Elaine,Where's Karen?
344.97,346.13,Secretary,She went to pick up lunch.
349.81,350.95,Elaine,She didn't ask me what I wanted.
351.97,353.03,Secretary,She must have forgot.
355.43,356.25,Elaine,How could she forget?
356.29,358.95,Elaine,I've been ordering lunch here every day for three and a half years.
360.26,363.72,Elaine,Is there something you're not telling me because I'm getting a really weird vibe.
365.37,368.35,Elaine,Is Lippman getting rid of me? It's OK. You can tell me. I won't say anything.
368.54,370.30,Secretary,I don't know anything.
371.52,376.13,Elaine,You don't know anything. You see. I don't know anything means that there's something to know if you really didn't know anything you would
376.15,378.02,Elaine,have said you're crazy.
378.72,379.11,Elaine,Oh.
379.30,380.06,Elaine,"Hi, mr. Lippman."
380.64,381.38,Lippman,Elaine.
382.22,386.92,Elaine,"Um, I was wondering if you got a chance to look at that biography of Columbus"
387.24,388.25,Elaine,I gave you?
388.25,389.10,Lippman,"Yes, I did."
391.27,391.79,Lippman,"Yes, I did."
394.24,395.89,Lippman,Maureen this water is still too cold.
396.07,397.74,Elaine,"Oh, yeah. It's freezing."
400.47,401.29,Elaine,Hurts your teeth.
407.27,408.97,Elaine,"I'm telling you, something is going on."
409.71,412.42,Elaine,He never likes anything I recommend and then that lunch thing.
413.50,415.13,Jerry,So they forgot to get your lunch. Big deal.
415.13,417.64,Elaine,What do you know? You've never worked in an office.
418.58,420.35,Elaine,"See, you've worked in an office, George."
420.41,422.34,Elaine,"You understand. Jerry thinks I'm overreacting,"
422.40,423.97,Elaine,but you understand lunch.
424.85,426.70,George,I don't understand lunch. I don't know anything about lunch.
426.78,429.15,George,"Listen, just because I got the guy fired"
429.19,430.89,George,"doesn't mean I turned him into a bum, does it?"
431.12,431.56,Elaine,What did he do?
432.16,433.75,George,He purposely mispronounced my name.
434.63,435.87,George,"Instead of saying Costanza,"
435.95,437.80,George,he'd say Can't-stan-ja.
439.00,440.07,George,Can't-stan-ja.
441.27,443.25,George,You made me smell my own gym socks once?
444.61,448.06,Jerry,I remember he made you wear a jock on your head for a whole class.
448.64,450.53,Jerry,And the straps were hanging down by his feet.
450.57,451.33,George,"Okay, okay."
451.89,453.22,George,You never even had him for Jim.
453.54,455.27,Jerry,I had him for hygiene. Remember his teeth?
455.99,457.71,Jerry,It was like from an exhumed corpse.
458.55,459.74,George,Little baked beans.
462.59,464.29,Elaine,"Come on, tell me what happened."
466.15,466.69,George,"Oh, okay."
467.97,469.69,George,"As I said, the guy had it in for me."
470.56,471.99,George,He actually failed me in gym.
472.40,472.74,George,Me!
474.02,476.24,George,Those spastic shnitzer twins
478.11,478.65,George,Can't stand ya!
479.20,480.10,George,"Yes, Mr. Heyman?"
480.40,482.88,Heyman,Your underwear was sticking out of your shorts during gym class.
483.10,485.47,George,"Oh, well, I guess that's because I wear boxer shorts."
485.57,486.57,Heyman,"Boxer shorts, huh?"
487.42,488.16,Heyman,What brand?
488.42,489.39,George,I'm not really sure.
489.39,490.59,Heyman,"Yeah, well, let's take a look."
492.61,494.16,George,He gave me a wedgie.
494.53,495.66,Jerry,He got fired the next day.
496.95,498.11,Elaine,Why do they call it a wedgie?
498.51,501.39,George,because the underwear is pulled up from the back until it
502.36,503.36,George,wedges in.
505.18,511.42,Jerry,They also have an atomic wedgie now the goal there is to actually get the waistband on top
511.48,513.13,Jerry,of the head.
513.58,514.27,Jerry,Very rare.
516.62,517.62,Elaine,Boys are sick.
517.80,518.80,Jerry,"Well, what do girls do?"
519.38,522.19,Elaine,We just tease someone un till they develop an eating disorder.
524.18,526.05,George,I got to go back to the library and talk to him.
526.43,528.44,George,I gotta find out if I'm the guy that ruined his life.
529.52,531.31,Kramer,"Hey, Babalu, you better get home."
531.49,533.16,Kramer,"You know, this guy Bookman from the library,"
533.22,533.86,Kramer,he's waiting for you.
535.09,536.71,Jerry,"What's amazing to me about the library is,"
536.73,538.46,Jerry,"now, here's a place where you can go in,"
538.52,539.81,Jerry,"you take out any book you want,"
539.87,540.91,Jerry,"they just give it to you,"
541.39,542.78,Jerry,"and say, bring it back when you're done."
543.78,545.39,Jerry,"It reminds me of, like, this pathetic friend"
545.41,546.58,Jerry,everybody had when they were a little kid
546.60,548.19,Jerry,that would let you borrow any of his stuff
548.37,550.01,Jerry,"if you would just be his friend, you know?"
550.50,551.35,Jerry,That's what the library is.
551.37,553.51,Jerry,"It's a government-funded, pathetic friend."
554.40,556.30,Jerry,And that's why everybody kind of bullies the library.
556.56,558.47,Jerry,"I'll bring it back on time, I'll bring it back late."
558.57,559.37,Jerry,"Oh, what are you gonna do?"
559.49,560.47,Jerry,"Well, you charge me nickel?"
563.21,565.18,Jerry,"Well, I'm glad you're here so we can get this all straightened out."
565.18,565.84,Jerry,Would you like a cup of tea?
566.14,566.81,Bookman,You got any coffee?
566.89,567.11,Jerry,Coffee?
567.39,567.93,Bookman,"Yeah, coffee."
568.25,569.22,Jerry,"No, I don't drink coffee."
569.32,570.12,Bookman,"Yeah, you don't drink coffee?"
570.20,571.01,Bookman,How about instant coffee?
571.41,572.01,Jerry,"No, I don't have..."
572.07,573.13,Bookman,You don't have any instant coffee?
573.27,574.22,Jerry,"Well, I don't normally."
574.24,575.12,Bookman,Who doesn't have instant coffee?
575.68,575.99,Jerry,I don't.
576.31,579.09,Bookman,"You buy a jar of Folgers crystals, you put it in the cupboard, you forget about it."
579.63,580.90,Bookman,"And later on when you need it, it's there."
580.90,581.48,Bookman,It lasts forever.
581.56,582.21,Bookman,It's freeze-dried.
582.61,583.33,Bookman,Freeze-dried Crystals.
586.09,586.99,Jerry,"Really, I'll have to remember that."
588.02,589.58,Bookman,You took this book out in 1971.
589.82,591.39,Jerry,"Yes, and I returned it in 1971."
591.39,593.39,Bookman,"Yeah, 1971. That was my first year on the job."
593.97,595.11,Bookman,Bad year for libraries.
595.43,596.53,Bookman,Bad year for America.
597.27,598.85,Bookman,Hippies burning library cards.
599.33,600.99,Bookman,Abby Huffman telling everybody to steal books.
601.83,604.30,Bookman,I don't judge a man by the length of his hair or the kind of music he listens to.
604.74,605.75,Bookman,Rock was never my bag.
606.13,609.11,Bookman,"But you put on a pair of shoes when you walk into the New York Public Library, fella."
609.38,610.44,Jerry,"Look, Mr. Bookman."
613.00,614.17,Jerry,I I returned that book.
614.36,615.71,Jerry,I remember it very specifically.
615.93,617.53,Bookman,You're a comedian. You make people laugh.
617.58,617.92,Jerry,I try.
618.10,619.32,Bookman,"You think this is all a big joke, don't you?"
622.59,623.37,Jerry,"No, I don't."
623.99,625.84,Bookman,I saw you on TV once. I remembered your name.
626.02,627.31,Bookman,From my list. I looked it up.
627.75,628.75,Bookman,"Sure enough, it checked out."
629.31,630.54,Bookman,You think because you're a celebrity
630.92,632.45,Bookman,"that somehow the law doesn't apply to you,"
632.51,633.41,Bookman,that you're above the law?
633.53,634.20,Jerry,Certainly not.
634.30,635.62,Bookman,"Well, let me tell you something funny for you."
637.45,638.39,Bookman,You know that little stamp?
638.85,640.32,Bookman,The one that says New York Public Library?
640.32,641.97,Bookman,"Well, that may not mean anything to you,"
642.03,642.93,Bookman,but that means a lot to me.
643.33,644.39,Bookman,One whole hell of a lot.
644.63,645.96,Bookman,"Sure, go ahead, laugh if you want to."
646.52,647.47,Bookman,I've seen your type before.
648.03,649.43,Bookman,"Flashy, making the scene,"
650.09,650.96,Bookman,flaunting convention.
651.84,652.75,Bookman,"Yeah, I know what you're thinking."
653.45,654.77,Bookman,What's this guy making such a big stink
654.81,655.88,Bookman,about old library books?
656.62,657.76,Bookman,"Well, let me give you a hint, you know."
659.67,661.07,Bookman,"Maybe we can live without libraries,"
661.13,662.42,Bookman,"people like you and me, maybe."
662.90,664.37,Bookman,"Sure, we're too old to change the world."
664.83,665.77,Bookman,"But what about that kid,"
666.15,667.70,Bookman,"sitting down, opening a book right now"
668.12,671.27,Bookman,in a branch of the local library and finding drawings of
671.81,678.04,Bookman,peepees and wee-wees and the cat in the hat and the five chinese brothers
678.90,679.99,Bookman,doesn't he deserve better?
680.39,683.07,Bookman,"Look, if you think this is about overdue fines and"
683.07,685.38,Bookman,"missing books, you better think again. This is about"
685.46,687.99,Bookman,that kid's right to read a book without getting his mind warped
688.25,692.20,Bookman,or maybe that turns you on Seinfeld. Maybe that's how you get your kicks
692.54,696.61,Bookman,You and your good time buddies i got a flash for you joy boy.
701.26,702.33,Bookman,Party time is over.
703.34,704.85,Bookman,"You got seven days, Seinfeld."
706.65,707.65,Bookman,That is one week.
713.90,714.60,Kramer,What's wrong?   i'm supposed
715.21,716.21,Marion,"It's Bookman, the library cop."
717.41,719.30,Kramer,So? I i didn't do anything wrong.
719.46,721.89,Marion,I was supposed to be at work. I could get fired.
721.89,723.38,Marion,I never should have come here.
724.85,725.86,Kramer,Why don't you leave?
730.59,731.23,Marion,I can't.
733.96,735.37,Jerry,No way I'm paying that.
736.13,737.97,Jerry,I returned that book in 1971.
739.05,740.53,Jerry,"I have a witness, Sherry Becker."
741.77,743.11,Jerry,She wore an orange dress.
744.11,745.70,Jerry,She gave me a piece of blackjack gum.
745.69,746.56,Jerry,It's a licorice gum.
746.56,748.03,Jerry,What do you think of next?
749.36,750.22,Jerry,I remember it!
756.37,757.53,Jerry,"Becker, Becker."
770.13,771.59,Sherry,Kevin went to a public school.
771.87,772.92,Sherry,He's the 14-year-old
773.19,776.00,Sherry,I'm gonna send Marsha to a private school.
776.70,780.69,Sherry,"Because in some ways, they don't learn enough."
781.59,782.03,Sherry,I think.
782.51,784.38,Jerry,"So, Sherry, what do you remember"
784.44,785.80,Jerry,about that day at the library?
786.71,788.89,Sherry,I remember it like it was yesterday.
789.87,791.22,Sherry,It was a Friday afternoon.
792.06,793.39,Sherry,I wore a purple dress.
793.91,794.39,Jerry,Purple?
795.21,796.35,Jerry,You sure it wasn't orange?
796.98,797.54,Sherry,Positive.
798.28,800.29,Sherry,And I was chewing dentine.
801.13,803.19,Sherry,I always chew dentine.
804.12,804.88,Sherry,"Remember, Jerry?"
805.32,805.92,Jerry,Dentine.
808.71,809.49,Jerry,No blackjack?
809.93,811.43,Sherry,"Ugh, licorice gum?"
811.90,812.14,Sherry,Never.
812.58,812.98,Jerry,What else?
814.69,817.84,Sherry,We were reading passages to each other
817.98,820.12,Sherry,from that Henry Miller book you had.
820.38,821.28,Jerry,Tropic of Cancer.
821.71,824.09,Sherry,"No, Tropica Capricorn."
825.12,826.34,Jerry,Tropica Capricorn?
827.06,827.79,Jerry,Remember?
829.51,835.14,Sherry,What holds the world together as I have learned from bitter experience
836.20,838.71,Sherry,is sexual intercourse.
842.81,845.59,Jerry,Wait a second. Wait a second. You're right. I had both of them.
845.94,850.50,Jerry,We read from Tropic of capricorn. I was all set to return Tropic of cancer.
850.85,851.71,Jerry,And then
853.45,853.93,Jerry,Here's the book.
854.23,854.63,George,"Oh, man."
854.84,856.71,Jerry,Don't let anybody see it. Don't let anything happen to it.
857.11,859.59,George,"Jerry, it's me, George. Don't worry. I'll return it tomorrow. No problem."
859.82,861.88,Jerry,All right. See you after school. Late for Heyman's Hygiene.
865.48,866.48,Sherry,Where are you going?
867.31,869.79,Jerry,It was nice seeing you again. I just remembered something. I've gotta go.
871.34,872.26,Jerry,It was George!
875.61,876.25,Kramer,Read another poem.
877.77,880.76,Marion,"Pressed chest, fleshed out west."
881.80,884.97,Marion,"might be the savior, or a garden pest."
886.97,888.08,Kramer,That is great poetry.
888.41,889.60,Kramer,You should be published.
890.55,891.11,Kramer,Jeez.
894.61,896.97,Kramer,"You know, the library's kind of a cool place when it's closed."
897.35,899.34,Marion,"Oh, yeah. You don't have to be quiet."
899.90,900.60,Marion,Listen to the echo.
901.61,902.08,Marion,Hello!
902.25,902.80,Kramer,Hello!
903.89,904.38,Marion,Hello!
904.38,905.07,Kramer,Hello!
905.77,906.47,Marion,
907.16,907.66,Bookman,Hello!
910.96,911.85,Marion,Mr. Bookman.
912.41,914.58,Bookman,I remember when the librarian was a much older woman.
915.88,917.91,Bookman,"Kindly, discreet, unattractive."
919.02,920.40,Bookman,We didn't know anything about her private life.
920.90,922.88,Bookman,We didn't want to know anything about her private life.
923.51,924.62,Bookman,She didn't have a private life.
925.96,926.79,Bookman,What are you thinking about that?
926.87,927.43,Bookman,Think about this.
927.89,930.08,Bookman,"The library closes at five o'clock, no exceptions."
930.74,931.80,Bookman,This is your final warning.
932.52,932.85,Bookman,Got that?
932.92,933.45,Bookman,kewpie-doll?
938.68,943.60,Elaine,Lippman wants to see me in his office. See me. That can't be good.
943.98,945.02,Jerry,Maybe you're getting a raise.
945.32,946.49,Elaine,Maybe I'm getting a wedgie.
951.16,951.60,Elaine,What?
951.80,952.44,George,It's George.
953.37,954.55,Elaine,George is on his way up.
954.69,956.02,Jerry,Wait till I tell him about the book.
958.75,959.19,Elaine,Are you okay?
960.77,961.27,Elaine,Why?
962.49,965.45,Kramer,"It's, uh, it's Marion's poetry!"
966.20,967.61,Kramer,I can't take it!
973.63,976.27,Elaine,You remember that biography I recommended?
976.51,978.00,Elaine,My boss hated it.
978.26,979.12,Jerry,I'm right here.
981.79,982.89,Elaine,Remember that Columbus book?
983.35,985.64,Jerry,Columbus. Eurotrash.
997.83,998.99,George,"Well, it's definitely him."
1002.34,1003.77,Elaine,Him? Him who?
1004.05,1004.80,George,Him who?
1005.78,1006.64,George,Heyman him.
1007.60,1010.16,Elaine,"Heyman, the gym teacher? You found him?"
1010.40,1011.12,George,"Oh, I found him."
1012.59,1014.29,George,He was sitting on the steps of the library.
1014.83,1016.17,George,I sat down next to him.
1016.92,1019.53,George,He smelled like the locker room after that game against Erasmus.
1019.85,1020.67,Jerry,That was double overtime.
1021.45,1025.62,George,"I said, Mr. Heyman, it's me, George Costanza."
1026.64,1028.07,George,"JFK, 71."
1029.08,1030.04,George,He doesn't move.
1031.22,1031.89,George,"So I said, uh,"
1032.87,1033.88,George,Can't stand ya?
1035.07,1035.84,George,Can't stand ya?
1037.32,1038.62,George,He turns and smiles.
1040.19,1041.45,George,their little baked bean teeth.
1043.13,1047.52,George,"I get up to run away, but something was holding me back."
1049.73,1050.29,George,It was Heyman.
1053.47,1054.45,George,He had my underwear.
1057.98,1063.67,George,"There I was on the steps of the 42nd Street Library, a grown man"
1065.79,1066.51,George,getting a wedgie.
1069.73,1070.91,Elaine,At least it wasn't atomic.
1073.39,1073.89,George,It was.
1079.05,1083.12,Jerry,"So, Georgie boy, guess what happened to Tropic of Cancer?"
1083.40,1083.98,George,How should I know?
1084.24,1085.19,Jerry,Because I gave it to you.
1085.89,1086.22,George,Me?
1086.61,1087.15,Jerry,"Yeah,think."
1087.19,1087.84,Jerry,Don't you remember?
1087.92,1091.17,Jerry,"You kept begging me to see it, then finally I agreed."
1091.71,1093.11,Jerry,You were supposed to return it.
1094.43,1096.18,Jerry,I met you in the gym locker room and gave it to you.
1098.37,1099.13,George,The locker room?
1100.87,1101.31,Jerry,Here's the book.
1102.25,1104.35,Jerry,Don't let anybody see it. Don't let anything happen to it.
1104.52,1107.07,George,"Jerry, it's me, George. Don't worry, I'll return it tomorrow. No problem."
1107.26,1109.34,Jerry,"Alright, I'll see you after school. I'm late for Heyman's hygiene."
1114.75,1115.55,Heyman,Can't stand ya!
1116.03,1116.72,George,"Yes, Mr. HeyMan?"
1116.86,1119.77,Heyman,Your underwear was sticking out of your shorts during gym class.
1120.15,1121.92,George,I guess that's because I wear boxer shorts.
1122.02,1123.49,Heyman,"Boxer shorts, huh?"
1123.71,1124.39,Heyman,What brand?
1125.21,1125.87,George,Not really sure.
1125.87,1126.94,Heyman,"Yeah, well let's take a look."
1127.48,1128.22,Heyman,Ha ha ha ha.
1140.53,1142.63,Jerry,"Anyway, I hope there's no hard feelings."
1145.65,1146.34,Bookman,Hard feelings?
1146.34,1147.49,Bookman,What do you know about hard feelings?
1150.79,1152.10,Bookman,You ever have a man die in your arms?
1152.34,1153.16,Bookman,You ever kill somebody?
1154.13,1155.05,Jerry,What is your problem?
1155.65,1156.32,Bookman,What's my problem?
1156.43,1157.68,Bookman,"Punks like you, that's my problem."
1158.96,1160.65,Bookman,"And you better not screw up again, Seinfeld,"
1160.65,1162.34,Bookman,"because if you do, I'll be all over you"
1162.42,1163.80,Bookman,like a pit bull on a poodle.
1167.39,1168.75,Jerry,That is one tough monkey.
1171.13,1171.90,Jerry,"So, you were saying?"
1172.76,1174.69,Elaine,"Oh, so, I took your suggestion,"
1175.13,1177.32,Elaine,"and I gave my boss Marion's poems,"
1177.32,1178.79,Elaine,It's the ones that affected Kramer so much.
1178.99,1180.35,Jerry,"Oh, beautiful. Did he like him?"
1181.27,1181.73,Elaine,"No, he didn't."
1184.67,1185.94,Elaine,"No, he didn't."
1189.09,1189.53,Jerry,Was he out there?
1190.13,1190.73,George,"No, he's gone."
1192.43,1193.44,George,I wonder what happened to him.
1194.24,1195.05,Jerry,I guess we'll never know.
1203.17,1204.13,Heyman,Can't stand ya.
1204.91,1205.97,Heyman,Can't stand ya.
1206.74,1207.38,Heyman,Can't stand ya.
1209.62,1210.62,Heyman,Can't stand ya.
1213.94,1217.81,Jerry,Any day that you had gym was a weird school day.
1218.28,1218.72,Jerry,You know what I mean?
1218.72,1220.37,Jerry,Because it like started off kind of normal.
1220.77,1223.59,Jerry,"You have like English, geometry, social studies."
1223.61,1225.54,Jerry,And then suddenly you're like in Lord of the Flies
1225.78,1228.05,Jerry,"for 40 minutes, you know, you're hanging from a rope."
1228.11,1229.57,Jerry,You have hardly any clothes on.
1230.29,1232.48,Jerry,"Teachers are yelling at you, where's your jockstrap?"
1232.52,1234.95,Jerry,"You know, and it's like, people are throwing dodge balls."
1235.01,1237.04,Jerry,"Hey, you're trying to survive, you know?"
1238.18,1241.69,Jerry,"And then it's history, science, language,"
1241.91,1244.40,Jerry,and something off in the whole flow of that day.
