1.51,3.89,J.D.,Even close friends disagree about decisions.
4.68,5.71,Turk,How about this one?
5.91,7.34,J.D.,You wanna get a clear shower curtain?
7.34,9.91,J.D.,Why don't I just nude up in the living room and you spray me down with a hose?
9.97,14.12,Turk,"Dude, if you're gonna be that self-conscious, I could always doodle in chest hairs right about where you'd stand."
14.36,18.07,J.D.,I have a chest hair. I named him Clancy. And then it happened.
18.65,19.47,SalesGirl,"Can I help you, sir?"
20.14,23.98,SalesGirl,Sir! Sir! Sir! Sir! Sir! Sir!
24.90,25.97,J.D.,I can't believe she called me sir.
26.47,27.52,Turk,She called me mister.
27.73,28.82,Carla,Maybe it's because you're bald.
29.52,31.21,Turk,I'm not bald. I shave my head.
31.49,32.43,Carla,"Well, then let it grow back."
33.09,33.62,Turk,"Careful, honey."
35.10,36.13,J.D.,We're practically kids.
36.61,38.48,Elliot,"Really? Well, what are you doing for Halloween tomorrow night?"
38.96,41.33,Turk,"Well, we used to dress up as pigs and hit every bar in town."
41.87,44.64,J.D.,"Yeah, you have not lived until you've seen a drunken pig do the robot."
47.51,50.22,Carla,She didn't ask what you used to do. She asked what you're doing this Halloween.
50.40,51.70,Turk,We got plans. Big plans.
52.18,52.95,Elliot,Watch Stevie and sleep?
53.33,53.83,Turk,"Yeah, pretty much."
54.35,55.35,J.D.,I may take a bath first.
56.05,56.34,Turk,Bubbles?
57.00,57.47,J.D.,Give me some.
60.21,62.84,J.D.,"It was sad, because I started to think that I'd never feel like a kid again."
64.36,67.53,Dan,"Hey-hey-hey, little brother! It's the head-lockin' Dan!"
67.53,68.66,J.D.,What the hell are you doing here?
68.88,70.03,Dr.Cox,"You know, it's funny, Vivian."
70.37,72.78,Dr.Cox,I was just going to ask you the exact same question.
72.92,76.37,Dr.Cox,Seems how I paged you four minutes and 38 seconds ago.
76.37,78.88,J.D.,"Dr. Cox is my big brother, Dan. He just showed up unexpected."
79.70,81.19,Dr.Cox,Four minutes and 44 seconds.
81.42,82.88,Dan,"Whoa, whoa. Easy there, chief."
83.16,85.68,Dan,"Oh, Why don't we have one of those nurses, there, pour you a big, tall glass of calm down juice."
86.76,88.19,J.D.,"Dan, um...mm mm"
88.99,90.00,Dr.Cox,"You know, Newbie, it's so interesting."
90.18,93.47,Dr.Cox,"I found I couldn't sleep last night, so in order to pass the time,"
93.67,96.48,Dr.Cox,I started to make a list of things that annoy me more than you.
96.74,100.99,Dr.Cox,"Anyway, I came up with People Who Call Wednesdays Hump Day"
101.16,102.80,Dr.Cox,"and, of course, all Sandra Bullock movies."
102.96,107.52,Dr.Cox,"But now I'm thrilled to announce your brother tops the list, which is..."
106.09,106.97,Dan,"Hey, Chief"
107.66,108.74,Dan,Does this speech have an intermission?
108.93,110.17,Dan,Because I gotta go to the lobby and take a wizz.
110.66,116.25,Dr.Cox,"Actually, I'm not so keen on nicknames from guys that barely know me."
117.27,119.90,Dan,"Actually, why don't you tell me what you are keen on?"
120.16,120.74,J.D.,"Oh, Dan, no."
121.21,122.03,Dan,Where's the crapper?
124.55,126.11,Carla,"So, Dan, what brings you to town?"
126.45,129.02,Dan,"Some guy hired me to fly here, drive his Mercedes back."
129.06,130.67,Dan,I figure it's an easy way to pick up some extra cash.
130.93,132.29,Carla,Unless you get to hang out with Bambi.
132.93,134.03,J.D.,Maybe I'll let that go.
134.61,135.19,Dan,Bambi?
135.46,137.64,J.D.,"Well, you know, it's a term of endearment that only Carla uses."
137.80,138.64,Dan,"I respect that, Bambi."
138.79,142.50,Carla,"Oh, that's smart, because you do not want to get on Bambi's bad side and suffer the wrath of Bambi."
143.49,144.59,J.D.,Why are you here?
145.47,148.93,Carla,"Oh, uh, room 310's test came back negative. I thought you might want to give me the good news."
149.28,149.64,Dan,Let me do it.
150.39,150.87,J.D.,What?
150.87,151.83,Dan,I can totally be a doctor.
152.21,153.12,J.D.,I can't let you tell him.
153.30,154.20,Dan,I won't call you Bambi anymore.
156.79,157.61,Dan,Touch and go there for a while.
158.03,159.25,Dan,You're a fighter. You pulled through.
159.62,162.83,Dan,"We're gonna get you out of here today, but I'd like you to keep an eye on those Rickles."
163.29,164.37,Patient,Rickles is my last name.
164.72,165.94,Dan,You bet it is. Do you have kids?
166.46,166.88,Patient,"Yeah, two."
167.26,168.79,Dan,That's what I'm saying. Let's keep an eye on the little rickles.
169.19,169.85,Dan,Children are our future.
170.78,172.42,J.D.,"Doctor, it's an emergency. We need you right away."
172.78,173.72,Dan,"Damn it, baby, I'm busy."
174.49,176.53,Dan,So hard to find a good male nurse these days. Am I right?
178.66,181.62,Singer,I can't do this all on my own
181.96,185.01,Singer,"No, I know, I'm no Superman"
188.58,190.03,Singer,I'm no Superman
191.78,194.51,J.D.,"You didn't understand, Elliot. Dan wasn't just the captain of every team."
194.51,196.08,J.D.,He was like the mayor of our high school.
196.48,200.25,J.D.,"The jocks dug him, the burnouts dug him, the nerds, like, worshipped him."
200.67,201.00,Elliot,What about you? 
201.00,202.08,Dan,He mentioned the nerds.
202.56,203.22,J.D.,"See, why hurt me?"
203.39,205.17,Elliot,"Yeah, I thought I was gonna be cool in high school for, like, five minutes,"
205.21,207.18,Elliot,but then my dad made me play the tuba in the marching band
207.22,208.62,Elliot,and I developed massive forearms.
209.15,212.47,Elliot,"Halfway through the prom, my silk gloves exploded off me like I was the Incredible Hulk."
212.92,215.38,Dan,I think it's sexy to dance with a woman who can lift a partner over her head.
216.55,218.66,J.D.,"You know, it's nice when your friends and family click."
219.34,222.01,J.D.,"It makes you feel like, wait a second, is she still laughing?"
222.57,223.07,Dan,That is.
239.96,242.30,J.D.,Stop your stupid laughing! It makes you look like a whore!
244.94,245.74,J.D.,Joking.
247.18,249.27,Lady,I appreciate everything you did for my husband.
249.68,252.03,Lady,The funeral's tomorrow and I'd love it if you could attend.
252.35,254.02,Turk,"Unfortunately, I'm in surgery all day."
254.90,256.01,Turk,"Still, I'm sorry for your loss."
258.27,260.45,Dr.Cox,Dodging a funeral nice.
261.25,261.63,Turk,Excuse me?
262.31,265.30,Dr.Cox,Just a veteran move from the baby-faced sophomore.
265.38,267.73,Dr.Cox,The whole I'm sorry for your loss thing
267.77,268.99,Dr.Cox,"was a little hallmark-y for me,"
269.09,270.60,Dr.Cox,but darn it all if you're not showing
270.66,271.96,Dr.Cox,just a ton of promise.
272.67,273.95,Turk,"If I could be there, I'd be there."
274.89,276.19,Turk,"Wait a second, you treated him, right?"
276.88,279.22,Turk,"So you should wanna go too, right?"
280.83,282.35,Dr.Cox,"Hey, Gandhi, for your information,"
282.49,284.94,Dr.Cox,I attended that poor vegetable's funeral every single time
285.00,287.09,Dr.Cox,I set foot in his room over the last six weeks.
288.25,290.54,Dr.Cox,"Thank God the family finally moved him over to surgery,"
290.70,292.53,Dr.Cox,where you guys were good enough to help him kick
292.61,295.42,Dr.Cox,that nasty oxygen habit he had once and for all.
295.94,296.90,Turk,That's great. Make jokes.
297.58,300.91,Turk,"You know, I wish I could be an insensitive, cynical robo-doc like you,"
300.95,303.16,Turk,"but unfortunately, I don't hate the world enough."
303.76,304.54,Turk,"You know what I'm saying, chief?"
308.04,310.08,Dr.Cox,Will people please stop calling me chief?
310.94,311.57,Dr.Kelso,"Hey, numbnuts."
313.41,315.20,J.D.,"Hey, Dan, do you remember when we were kids"
315.24,317.00,J.D.,and every Halloween you used to always try
317.06,318.27,J.D.,and scare the crap out of me?
318.73,319.43,Dan,Aah!
321.57,323.07,Dan,"Yeah, I remember that."
323.73,324.88,Dan,"So, while I'm here,"
324.88,326.65,Dan,we should play some frisbee golf.
327.63,329.00,Dan,We should maybe give Dad a call.
329.24,329.44,Dan,Dad.
330.41,332.06,Dan,"Oh, should definitely make sure I sleep with that Elliot chick."
332.46,337.77,J.D.,"That's a little weird for me 'cause, I don't know if you'd know this or not, but we used to be intimate."
338.59,338.91,Dan,Intimate?
339.35,340.03,Dan,"What'd you do, bathe her?"
341.17,343.10,J.D.,"Yeah, once, but she was wearing a swimsuit."
343.88,344.43,Dan,"All right, I get it."
344.55,344.97,Dan,I'll back off.
345.19,347.32,Dan,"It's gonna be tough, though, because she sounds kind of wild."
348.64,349.43,J.D.,"Gee, gee."
350.25,350.69,Dan,Can't teach it.
352.39,353.13,Dr.Cox,"Come on, let's go."
353.30,354.68,Dr.Cox,You've got an opposable thumb.
354.82,355.64,Dr.Cox,You can use it.
356.67,357.71,Dr.Cox,"God, I hate Halloween."
358.27,360.74,Carla,Somebody needs to adjust their attitude if they want some candy.
361.12,365.03,Dr.Cox,"You mean, the popcorn balls and the deformed lollipops."
365.03,366.83,Dr.Cox,"I mean, honestly, where do you get this crap anyway?"
367.56,368.04,NurseRoberts,I made it.
369.14,372.93,NurseRoberts,"If you want name brand candy, my fish is packed with peanuts."
373.45,374.10,Dr.Cox,Of course it is.
374.86,375.69,Carla,"Oh, what's the matter?"
375.75,376.97,Carla,Did Raggedy Ann scare you?
377.69,378.35,Dr.Cox,"What are you, a rat?"
380.30,381.22,Turk,"Don't listen to him, baby."
381.76,382.24,Carla,I never do.
382.89,385.27,Turk,"So Dr. Cox, your intern asked for a surgical consult"
385.29,385.86,Turk,on Mr. Carney?
386.04,386.46,Dr.Cox,Yeah.
386.46,388.14,Turk,I suggest we do a fem pop bypass.
388.44,390.25,Dr.Cox,Mr. Carney is a frail old man who
390.81,393.15,Dr.Cox,probably snap in half from a light sponge bath.
393.30,394.82,Turk,"All I'm saying is if we do surgery,"
395.20,396.43,Turk,we can improve his quality of life.
396.65,397.89,Dr.Cox,"The guy's 1,000."
398.11,399.56,Dr.Cox,"What's he gonna take a steamer over to Europe,"
399.63,401.28,Dr.Cox,open up a cafe and finally meet
401.36,403.17,Dr.Cox,that 900-year-old girl of his dreams?
403.53,404.63,Turk,I made my recommendation.
405.33,407.22,Dr.Cox,You stood up for what you believe in and I respect that.
407.72,409.03,Dr.Cox,"Thank you, 20 bucks says you killed him."
409.29,409.89,Turk,You're on.
409.89,410.49,Dr.Cox,"You got it, baby."
413.25,413.85,Dr.Cox,Oh.
414.12,415.93,Dr.Cox,Can I get some sugar over here?
420.19,425.89,Dr.Kelso,"Finally, can anyone tell me the dermatologic condition associated with rhinophyma, Dr. Murphy?"
426.78,428.27,Doug,"Uh, could it be psoriasis?"
428.89,432.44,Dr.Kelso,And yet further proof that the clown costume is redundant.
434.24,440.25,Dr.Kelso,"Now, if any of you other would-be revelers get the urge to dress up on this, the mother of all non-holidays,"
440.54,444.15,Dr.Kelso,please consider me the razor blade in your caramel apple.
444.47,445.62,Dr.Kelso,"We're professionals, damn it!"
447.84,450.34,Dr.Kelso,"You know, it's nothing personal, son."
451.06,452.07,Dr.Kelso,You just make me sick.
454.13,454.77,Doug,He called me son.
456.10,456.72,Doug,He called me son.
456.96,457.36,J.D.,Score.
459.43,459.77,J.D.,"Oh, yeah."
460.05,461.80,Elliot,"So, uh, you going to lunch with your brother?"
462.22,463.77,J.D.,"Yeah, you know, I would have invited you,"
463.77,465.01,J.D.,but I already made the reservation for two.
465.92,466.96,Elliot,So call and change it to three.
467.48,468.75,J.D.,"Oh, I'm not gonna mess with that hostess."
468.75,470.03,J.D.,"You know, she uses sharp tones."
470.80,471.14,Elliot,"Yeah, right."
471.52,472.93,Elliot,I'll give you three seconds to give me the real reason
472.92,474.39,Elliot,"why I can't go to lunch, otherwise I'm coming."
476.09,479.74,Elliot,"Three, two, one."
481.74,483.47,J.D.,Because I need special time with my brother.
485.25,485.83,Janitor,Trick.
485.95,486.50,Janitor,Execuse me.
486.72,488.30,Janitor,"I just figured you gotta be wondering,"
488.46,492.11,Janitor,"am I gonna get a trick, or am I gonna get a treat?"
494.17,494.99,Janitor,You'll be getting a trick.
495.59,496.30,J.D.,Whatever.
496.82,498.99,Janitor,"You'll be fast, and you won't even know it's me."
500.33,501.65,J.D.,You just told me it was gonna be you.
502.30,503.12,Janitor,You'll still have your doubts.
504.32,507.13,Janitor,"And the best part is, you're gonna be nervous all day about it."
507.75,510.30,Janitor,Because it could happen at any time.
512.37,512.75,Janitor,"Nick, no!"
514.29,516.24,Janitor,"That wasn't it. Fun, though."
518.35,519.30,J.D.,"False alarm, boys."
521.25,523.99,Turk,"All right. Here we go, Mr. Carney."
526.12,528.58,Turk,"Dr. Wen. I want you to stay focused, okay?"
529.00,531.57,Turk,"I want Dr. Wen to be Dr. Zen, man."
531.84,535.33,Dr.Wen,"Christopher, after 15 years and over 10,000 surgeries."
536.11,537.21,Dr.Wen,I think I can do without the pep talk.
538.07,539.33,Turk,"Message received, sir."
541.95,543.18,Turk,I believe in you.
546.79,548.73,J.D.,"So, big deal. We're having lunch together."
548.77,549.84,J.D.,It doesn't have to be awkward.
550.25,551.49,Dan,"So, what's my little bro like in the sack?"
551.81,552.17,Elliot,What?
552.51,553.51,J.D.,You do not have to answer that.
554.05,555.98,Dan,"If he tries hard but there's room for improvement,"
555.98,556.75,Dan,Take a sip of your drink.
559.95,560.33,J.D.,Hey.
561.33,562.03,Elliot,What? I was thirsty.
562.50,564.01,J.D.,"All right, you know, fine. Ask me if she could be better."
568.64,569.88,J.D.,What? Thirsty?
570.53,571.39,Elliot,I wasn't thirsty.
575.13,576.85,Turk,Stable condition.
577.62,578.60,Turk,What time is it?
578.88,579.82,Turk,Time to dance.
583.39,588.88,Turk,"Come on, with it, uh, uh, come on, bring it back, come on, hee-hee!"
589.12,590.25,Turk,"Ooh, pay the man."
591.07,591.49,Dr.Cox,There you go.
592.17,597.54,Turk,"Hello, Mr. Jackson. I want to introduce you to the Washington brothers."
598.40,601.55,Turk,Y'all get nice and cozy. Up in my wallet.
601.85,607.10,Dr.Cox,"Now, before you get too awful high up on your horse there, Tonto, I feel it's my duty to remind you of just a little something."
607.84,612.03,Dr.Cox,"See, you just made a $20 bet on whether a fellow human being"
612.03,613.00,Dr.Cox,would live or die.
614.30,616.47,Dr.Cox,"Now tell me, just exactly how does that"
616.53,617.69,Dr.Cox,"make you feel, Mr. Sensitive?"
618.53,619.11,Dr.Cox,Pretty good?
620.32,620.87,Dr.Cox,"Oh, the best."
630.53,632.84,Elliot,"So, uh, why'd you drive someone else's car cross country?"
633.28,634.77,Dan,It is a great way to make 300 bucks.
636.03,637.61,Elliot,What do you do that you could take that kind of time off?
637.71,638.28,Dan,I tend bar.
638.74,640.20,J.D.,"But not just like any bar, it's like the bar."
640.44,642.47,J.D.,It's like when all the college kids come home from Thanksgiving
642.47,643.25,J.D.,and it's like where everybody goes.
643.35,644.13,J.D.,I go there when I'm home.
644.83,646.06,Elliot,So you still live in your hometown?
646.56,647.79,Dan,"Yeah, I kind of take care of my mom's place"
647.79,648.55,Dan,so she likes me to stay with her.
649.79,650.89,J.D.,"Well, Ben, you don't stay with her."
651.43,653.56,J.D.,"I mean, come on, he's not like Greg Brady"
653.62,655.23,J.D.,living in the attic with beads for a door.
655.41,657.37,J.D.,"I mean, he totally has his own space."
658.08,661.26,J.D.,More like Kirk Cameron and the last season of Growing Pains
661.28,662.76,J.D.,when he lived above the garage with Boner.
663.51,663.85,J.D.,Anyone?
664.75,665.77,J.D.,Am I the only one? Boner?
666.36,666.80,J.D.,No?
667.13,669.52,J.D.,"And that's when I realized that even though I was a little jealous,"
669.82,672.15,J.D.,that's not why I was trying to keep Elliott and Dan apart.
672.75,673.53,J.D.,Dan's doing great.
674.01,676.39,J.D.,The real reason was that I was ashamed of my brother.
677.10,678.13,J.D.,"And I think he knew it, too."
678.78,680.32,Dan,You two should probably get back to work.
690.49,693.39,Elliot,These heated seats are amazing. They make my butt tingle.
693.53,695.15,Dan,"And every time you say that, an angel gets their wings."
696.58,698.69,Dan,"No, it's a sweet ride, but as J.D. has made it so abundantly clear,"
699.15,699.97,Dan,I can never afford this car.
700.61,701.60,J.D.,Would you please just let it go?
702.80,704.43,Elliot,So I'll... I'll see you.
704.69,705.35,Dan,Not if I see you first.
706.71,709.06,J.D.,Somehow I knew my brother would handle this the way he always did
709.10,710.97,J.D.,when there was a deep emotional conflict between us.
711.63,712.75,Dan,So can you work the windows from back there?
713.59,713.97,J.D.,"No, why?"
715.52,716.41,J.D.,"Oh, God. "
717.81,719.75,J.D.,"Oh, please tell me that that was the horn."
719.94,721.04,Dan,"There's your heated seat, my friend."
721.37,723.17,J.D.,"Oh, God! It's everywhere!"
732.04,735.72,Dr.Kelso,Do you people have any idea how long I've been waiting on you next time?
735.89,738.64,Dr.Kelso,"If you're not here in 30 minutes or less, I expect a free dead body,"
738.80,739.85,Dr.Kelso,or at least some garlic knots.
740.25,742.21,Turk,"Dr. Kelso, I think that's extremely insensitive."
742.89,743.62,Dr.Kelso,I don't think so.
744.34,745.54,Dr.Kelso,"Miss Parker, you care to weigh in?"
746.93,749.07,Dr.Kelso,"Nope, she's fine with it, and she knows a thing or two."
749.55,751.74,Dr.Kelso,"Except, of course, that a yellow light means to slow down."
753.34,754.83,Turk,You're not understanding what I'm trying to tell you.
756.57,757.55,Turk,"Kitty, this sucks."
758.12,758.86,Carla,How can I make it better?
760.90,762.17,Lady,Thank you so much for coming.
762.97,764.55,Turk,Are you kidding? We've been looking forward to this.
765.86,767.85,Turk,"You know, ever since he died."
772.39,772.81,Elliot,"Hey, you okay?"
774.05,774.77,J.D.,Yeah. Why wouldn't I be?
775.48,778.52,Elliot,"You and your brother? I mean, come on, the tension on the ride back to work was palpable."
778.92,781.37,Elliot,"I wanted to say something. I mean, I was this close to getting back in the car."
781.99,784.90,J.D.,"That wouldn't have been a wise choice. No, seriously. Thank you, Elliot. We're fine."
791.15,792.67,J.D.,"Damn you, you dirty ape!"
795.44,802.68,Carla,"Babe, you have got to try one of these. They are to die for. I'm sorry for your loss. Go ahead, try one."
805.51,807.97,Lady,"Mother, this is Dr. Turk, the surgeon that works so hard."
808.60,809.86,Turk,Please it's the least I could do for
812.59,814.64,Mother,You see he doesn't even remember his name.
815.22,817.89,Turk,no no no no I remember his name his name was
820.47,821.17,Turk,His name was
826.07,826.63,Turk,You know
827.19,829.03,Turk,We used to call him old chicken neck.
829.35,831.63,Lady,This is the problem with doctors today. They don't care.
831.86,837.42,Turk,"No no. It's just that recently I've had a lot of patients, and so I've gotten I've been really busy."
837.67,841.14,Lady,Not too busy to come here in the middle of the day and stuff your face with free food.
842.06,842.55,Turk,"Damn you, woman."
843.05,847.43,Carla,"Ladies, please. This is a good, caring doctor. He did everything he could for Bob."
848.02,848.38,Lady,Right.
850.27,851.99,Turk,This is Bob. That's Bob?
852.53,854.12,Carla,"It's like for apples, you know, Bob."
857.67,860.47,J.D.,"Oh, I get it. Well, let's see how tough you are without your costume on."
861.03,863.17,J.D.,Go ahead and knock the folders out of my hand now.
867.71,868.58,Janitor,What costume?
868.57,869.92,J.D.,You weren't wearing a gorilla suit before?
869.92,871.74,Janitor,There's someone running around in a gorilla suit?
872.59,873.39,Janitor,What's it look like?
873.89,874.64,J.D.,Gorilla?
875.31,876.07,Janitor,It's not me.
876.07,877.64,J.D.,Then why did you knock the folder out of my hand?
877.82,878.88,Janitor,Because you asked me to.
879.80,880.35,Janitor,Here you go.
881.96,883.08,J.D.,I didn't ask you to do that.
883.60,885.39,Janitor,That comes free with a folder knock.
889.52,890.81,Dr.Kelso,"Hey sport, how are you doing?"
891.06,891.50,J.D.,"Oh good, sir."
891.51,893.64,Dr.Kelso,I don't have time to stand here and flirt son
893.65,897.88,Dr.Kelso,There have been rumblings that you let your brother play doctor the other day
898.39,899.39,J.D.,"Dr. Kelso, I"
899.38,903.31,Dr.Kelso,Dr. Dorian if I had one shred of evidence that incident actually took place
903.33,906.69,Dr.Kelso,You would be working with my nephew Francis so fast. It'd make your head spin.
906.90,907.75,J.D.,"Sir, I don't follow."
907.90,908.90,Dr.Kelso,He cleans pools.
909.58,913.87,Dr.Kelso,"I forgot you didn't know that. Well, anyway, I trust we will not be seeing your brother in the hospital again"
915.78,916.60,J.D.,"Not inside, no."
917.64,919.21,Turk,"Oh, my God, I'm totally going to hell."
919.57,920.25,Carla,"Turk, wait!"
920.67,922.40,Carla,People get thrown out of funerals every day.
925.27,926.10,Dr.Cox,Oh.
926.81,927.67,Carla,Why are you laughing?
928.27,931.16,Dr.Cox,"Well, top of my head, I'd have to say it's because he's suffering."
931.66,935.25,Dr.Cox,"But, of course, I love the poetry of someone putting himself way up on a pedestal"
935.27,938.38,Dr.Cox,and then getting knocked the hell back down into this puddle of self-hatred.
939.16,940.01,Dr.Cox,We had the rest of us.
940.69,941.73,Carla,Did you do this to him?
942.29,942.94,Dr.Cox,"Well, I don't know."
944.60,947.10,Dr.Cox,Does anybody ever really do anything to anybody else?
947.96,950.65,Carla,"You're gonna tell me why you did this, and it better be good."
951.67,954.04,Dr.Cox,How does for poops and giggles grab you?
960.35,961.85,Elliot,Isn't there something you guys want to talk about?
962.99,965.90,Elliot,"You know, like cars or sports or boobs?"
965.94,967.87,Dan,I'll talk about boobs. Remember Fred Kiefer's mom?
968.27,970.65,J.D.,She wore a tank top to Fred's 13th birthday party.
971.62,974.42,J.D.,"She taught us how to bob for apples, and the three guys passed out."
975.64,978.05,Elliot,Great story. Now how about something with a little more substance?
979.31,980.65,Dan,"Dude, remember the cans on Pat Clark's mom?"
981.16,982.65,J.D.,"Yeah, those were awesome."
982.97,983.63,Elliot,You know what? Forget it.
984.33,985.47,J.D.,"Elliot, come on."
986.56,987.88,J.D.,What is she expecting us to talk about?
988.52,990.23,Dan,I don't know. Maybe the fact that you're so embarrassed by me
990.33,992.25,Dan,that you make excuses to your friends about how I live my life.
994.98,995.67,J.D.,"Hell, yeah."
1001.31,1003.20,J.D.,We're... we're working hard on a cure.
1005.50,1006.54,Dr.Cox,Let's go. Field trip.
1007.03,1007.88,Turk,"I got things to do, you know."
1008.06,1009.45,Dr.Cox,"Let me guess, you're off to another funeral."
1009.53,1010.10,Dr.Cox,I'll make you a deal.
1010.18,1011.39,Dr.Cox,"You come with me right now,"
1011.57,1013.02,Dr.Cox,"and if you're still late for the graveyard,"
1013.06,1015.54,Dr.Cox,"I will personally scour the obituaries with you this weekend,"
1015.56,1016.36,Dr.Cox,and we can just go nuts.
1017.13,1017.87,Turk,Carla put you up to this?
1017.87,1018.70,Dr.Cox,"No, that was my idea."
1018.74,1020.05,Dr.Cox,I desperately want to be close with you.
1020.07,1021.45,Dr.Cox,I just can't figure out how to connect.
1021.65,1022.03,Dr.Cox,Turn around.
1023.36,1023.79,Dr.Cox,Turn around.
1026.55,1027.47,Dr.Cox,You see Dr. Wen in there?
1028.83,1031.28,Dr.Cox,"He's explaining to that family that something went wrong,"
1031.38,1032.57,Dr.Cox,and that the patient died.
1033.63,1035.63,Dr.Cox,"He's gonna tell them what happened, he's gonna say he's sorry,"
1035.67,1037.30,Dr.Cox,and then he's going back to work.
1038.79,1040.81,Dr.Cox,You think anybody else in that room's going back to work today?
1042.63,1045.55,Dr.Cox,That is why we distance ourselves.
1045.54,1047.57,Dr.Cox,That's why we make jokes.
1048.48,1050.04,Dr.Cox,"We don't do it, because it's fun."
1051.49,1052.79,Dr.Cox,We do it so we can get by.
1054.17,1056.99,Dr.Cox,"Then, sometimes because it's fun."
1059.65,1062.42,Dr.Cox,But mostly it's the getting by thing.
1064.12,1065.46,Dr.Cox,"Oh, and by the way"
1066.90,1067.69,Dr.Cox,Bob?
1068.59,1069.72,Dr.Cox,Who doesn't get that?
1076.17,1077.83,Dan,"Look, J.D., we're all proud you became a doctor,"
1077.85,1080.28,Dan,but just because I haven't achieved as much as you
1080.36,1081.30,Dan,Doesn't mean I don't like what I do.
1081.64,1083.21,J.D.,"Dan, there's nothing wrong with being a bartender."
1083.89,1084.63,Dan,I like living with Mom.
1085.12,1085.96,J.D.,She makes great eggs.
1086.96,1089.29,Dan,"All in all, I'm pretty damn happy."
1090.69,1091.41,Dan,"I'm happy, you know?"
1092.51,1093.82,J.D.,And now for the apology.
1094.52,1095.28,J.D.,That's a load of crap.
1096.93,1098.33,J.D.,"Look, I know you, OK?"
1098.97,1101.30,J.D.,I know the reason you wanted to pretend you're a doctor
1101.38,1102.87,J.D.,yesterday is because you hate working in that bar
1102.87,1104.61,J.D.,and you wanted to feel like somebody for once.
1105.95,1108.28,J.D.,"Come on, Dan, you're not driving that car"
1108.28,1109.89,J.D.,across the country for the $300.
1109.89,1113.61,J.D.,You're doing it because you like the way you feel when you drive it. And the funny
1113.62,1118.04,J.D.,thing is you could be that guy but you're afraid that it if you actually
1118.06,1121.75,J.D.,have to try at something you might fail and that's just not a chance you're
1121.75,1122.31,J.D.,willing to take.
1125.27,1125.79,Dan,What can I say?
1128.36,1129.68,Dan,It's been a real pleasure seeing you.
1130.50,1131.81,Singer#2,Another day
1134.33,1136.56,Singer#2,I call and they'll speak
1135.84,1136.29,J.D.,Dan.
1137.36,1138.61,Singer#2,And you would say
1140.19,1142.72,Singer#2,Nothing's changed at all
1144.14,1145.09,Singer#2,And I can't leave
1145.63,1148.26,J.D.,Right then I knew I'd never see my brother the same way again.
1148.26,1150.23,Singer#2,But you're for everything
1150.89,1156.25,Singer#2,If I won't be there to catch you when you fall
1158.58,1163.29,Singer#2,Again It seems we meet.
1164.74,1167.00,Singer#2,In the spaces
1166.01,1168.33,J.D.,You can never let go of the kid inside of you.
1168.99,1171.60,Turk,"Dude, that girl in the wolf outfit is totally checking you out!"
1172.08,1174.64,J.D.,"I'd better blow my house down, you know what I'm saying?"
1175.16,1176.69,Singer#2,Won't belong.
1178.92,1182.42,J.D.,"You see, it's the kid inside of us that keeps us all from going crazy."
1182.04,1182.67,Turk,a cashew!
