1.52,5.00,J.D.,"Work seems different now that I'm a resident. I feel more confident, more like a..."
5.52,7.05,J.D.,"hell, I'll say it, a doctor."
7.41,8.13,J.D.,"Good morning, people."
10.52,11.86,J.D.,"You're gonna be fine, ma'am."
12.72,13.27,Woman #2,I work here.
14.39,16.23,J.D.,Still doesn't change the fact that you're gonna be fine.
16.77,19.66,Dr. Cox,Why in the hell are you wearing a coat?
20.46,21.31,J.D.,Because I'm a doctor.
22.05,24.93,Dr. Cox,"Look, Babs, if you're truly worried about people seeing your ass,"
24.95,27.94,Dr. Cox,just go ahead and do what all the other girls do and tie a sweater around your waist.
28.39,29.43,J.D.,"Well, I look doctorly."
29.43,33.21,Dr. Cox,"No, you who goes to a garage sale buys a bronze star, pins it to his lapel"
33.21,37.46,Dr. Cox,And then tells everybody to call him sarge. And newbie. Nobody likes that guy not a soul.
39.88,41.01,Janitor,I was in the military.
41.82,42.82,J.D.,Where did you come from?
43.27,47.76,Janitor,"If I find out you're wearing a bronzy, without having served, I'm gonna make things uncomfortable for you"
48.54,51.67,J.D.,Coat wearing doctors do not take this crap. You were never in the military.
53.03,53.74,Janitor,"Yes, I was."
53.94,54.75,J.D.,Which branch?
55.64,57.10,Janitor,The janitor branch
57.93,58.51,J.D.,I'm watching you.
60.35,61.34,J.D.,"That's right, Sasquatch."
62.40,63.89,J.D.,"You see, things have changed."
65.35,67.36,J.D.,We've begun to adapt to new situations.
67.86,69.23,Turk,"Oh, my back is on fire."
70.21,71.41,Turk,"If Dr. Amato was any shorter,"
71.41,73.28,Turk,I'd be passing him instruments with my feet.
73.60,74.94,Dr. Amato,"Dr. Turk, I need you down here."
76.77,77.61,Turk,Coming down.
78.93,80.66,J.D.,Even other people are starting to see us differently.
81.52,82.27,Dr. DiStefano,"Hey there, doctor."
83.79,85.95,Elliot,"Oh, wait. Of course. Because I'm a doctor."
86.27,87.62,Elliot,"I mean, I've got the, uh, I've got the outfit."
88.00,90.73,Elliot,"I've got the, uh, heart, uh, hearing thingy."
91.11,91.71,Elliot,"Uh, ""stethoscope""."
92.93,95.16,Elliot,"Oooh, paging Dr. Know It All to the cafeteria!"
100.39,102.37,Turk,"Oh, sweet baby James."
103.23,105.94,J.D.,"Most importantly, we've started to treat each other with respect."
106.86,108.45,Turk,"Dude, you're such a loser, man."
108.69,109.69,J.D.,I think I look spiffy.
110.07,111.66,J.D.,I'm trying to separate myself from the whole pack.
112.00,113.07,Carla,"Oh, you already have, Bambi."
113.11,114.77,Carla,You're the biggest geek to ever come through here.
114.77,115.84,Turk,"Yeah, yeah, he is."
116.22,118.32,Carla,"Don't laugh, you're the jockey frat boy with a back problem."
118.60,119.12,Turk,"Yeah, I am."
119.42,120.89,Elliot,"Oh, do me, do me, do me."
121.75,122.47,J.D.,You're gonna want to be careful
122.49,123.54,J.D.,about yelling that out in the bar.
124.18,125.77,Elliot,"I'm serious, all you guys get to be something."
125.85,127.57,Elliot,"The dork, the jock, the spicy firecracker"
127.63,128.51,Elliot,from the school of hard knocks.
129.12,129.60,Elliot,"No offense, Carla."
130.51,131.27,Elliot,"Damn it, what am I?"
132.41,132.89,Carla,You're white.
133.31,134.01,Turk,The whitest.
134.26,134.76,J.D.,"Yeah, you are."
135.44,136.57,Elliot,"Oh, come on, JD's white."
137.77,139.31,J.D.,"I ain't hearing that woman,"
139.46,140.60,J.D.,cause I'm talking to him.
142.35,143.07,Turk,"Okay, it's a tie."
145.56,146.56,J.D.,T. Diddy?
147.66,153.75,Singer,"I can't do this all on my own. No, I know. I'm no superman"
157.50,158.91,Singer,I'm no superman.
161.15,163.39,Mr. Blair,You got me in the ICU for a cold?
163.59,166.72,J.D.,"Mr. Blair, you have a severe sinus infection with orbital extension."
166.96,171.47,J.D.,"You were admitted delirious from your 106 degree temperature, completely naked and very"
171.47,172.56,J.D.,very adamant about staying that way.
173.26,173.78,Mr. Blair,I was hot.
174.67,175.49,Nurse Roberts,I'll second that.
176.39,177.07,Nurse Roberts,Mm-hmm.
178.03,178.80,Dr. Kelso,"Sharp coat, sport."
179.68,180.67,J.D.,"Well, yeah, it's spiffy."
181.13,182.05,Dr. Cox,"Shocker, Big Bob."
182.23,184.72,Dr. Cox,You care more about appearances than actual men.
183.87,185.25,Dr. Kelso,"Better finish that thought quickly, Perry."
185.26,186.28,Dr. Kelso,I'm not breaking my gait.
186.27,189.88,Dr. Cox,Just saying
189.88,190.10,Dr. Kelso,Not.
190.10,191.60,Dr. Kelso,"Ah, too slow."
191.78,193.35,J.D.,Think he really got through to them.
195.61,197.03,J.D.,"Oh, my God, you hear like a bat."
199.03,199.55,J.D.,Idiot.
200.28,202.93,J.D.,I wish I had a guy in my life that would stop me before I did something stupid.
210.08,213.82,Singer Man,Mistake!
214.49,215.61,J.D.,I don't know why he's an opera singer.
216.35,217.75,Dr. Cox,"Listen closely, tiny dancer."
217.85,221.82,Dr. Cox,I wouldn't be flapping my mouth if I'd forgotten to get a blood culture on Mr. Blair.
221.92,227.35,Dr. Cox,"And for the love of God, do you at least remember what you were doing the day they were passing out common sense?"
227.58,234.18,Dr. Cox,Oh gosh. Maybe you were running late that day because you just couldn't find the right thong for those lowrider jeans that you love so much.
234.22,240.07,Dr. Cox,Or maybe you were busy bopping along to whatever boyband really makes your heart race nowadays and you just drove on by.
240.07,243.18,Dr. Cox,"Of course, I don't know. I'm just guessing. But one thing's sure shooting."
243.44,249.15,Dr. Cox,"You wound up at the Dum Dum store and you just went ahead and put as much of that into the car as you could fit, didn't you?"
249.49,252.26,J.D.,And then I did something I've never done before.
253.00,257.29,J.D.,"Look, doctor, if you flip the page on that chart you'd see that I pan-cultured him yesterday."
257.55,260.60,J.D.,But that would probably get in the way of the perverse pleasure you take in pointing out other people's slip-ups.
260.90,266.33,J.D.,"Well too bad, Buster Brown, because I'm a resident now and I'm not gonna be making the same little silly intern mistakes I made last year."
267.00,269.02,J.D.,I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't stand here and yell at me in front of a patient.
270.04,270.67,Dr. Cox,Buster Brown.
270.75,274.64,J.D.,"Buster Brown, focus all energy on lip, not quivering."
277.02,277.61,J.D.,Wow.
278.83,279.85,Carla,"How's the back, sweetness?"
280.19,280.60,Turk,Perfect.
281.56,285.83,Turk,"Baby, I'm sorry the last couple of nights I haven't been able to give you the regular doses of the turkey jerky,"
286.50,289.50,Turk,but you rest assured your man will be back in action before you know it.
289.80,290.87,Carla,You go ahead and take your time.
293.33,297.40,Dr. Amato,"Hey there, big fella. Just checked the board. We're together on a thyroidectomy this afternoon."
297.55,298.55,Dr. Amato,Could be a long one.
299.11,300.35,Turk,"Oh, that's great, Dr. Amato."
301.79,303.48,J.D.,"Domo arigato, Dr. Amato."
306.59,307.33,J.D.,How is that not funny?
307.87,308.50,Turk,"I don't know, dude."
309.32,311.18,J.D.,"You know, you guys are getting to be like Starsky and Hutch."
311.80,314.35,Turk,That'd be true if Starsky was a ventriloquist and Hutch was a tiny puppet.
314.63,315.35,J.D.,I would watch that show.
315.62,315.71,Turk,Yeah.
316.07,317.10,J.D.,Why do you keep ending up with that guy?
317.52,320.35,Turk,Because the other surgeons are busting my chops for skipping Guy's night out.
320.73,323.02,J.D.,"Oh, what, ending up with Dr. Amato is like a punishment or something?"
322.68,325.55,Turk,"No, dude, I actually enjoy needing you to lower me on the toilet in the morning."
326.16,326.76,J.D.,Check that out.
327.38,329.68,J.D.,"I know it looks innocent, but Elliot was late this morning."
330.26,333.01,J.D.,"Plus, once you've been here a while, you learn to read between the lines."
344.49,346.32,Elliot,"Well, Mrs. Bumbry, I wish I had better news,"
346.40,348.65,Elliot,"but unfortunately you didn't qualify for the G.I. clinical trial,"
348.77,350.51,Elliot,so we'll just keep plugging away.
350.88,353.04,Mrs. Bumbry,Great. So how was the sex with that guy?
353.56,353.82,Elliot,What guy?
354.33,354.91,Elliot,"Oh, I wasn't, I wasn't"
354.91,355.46,Carla,Elliot.
355.81,358.38,Carla,I have other patients. Mrs. Bumbry needs a nap. We're all very busy.
360.73,364.27,Elliot,I have never done anything like this. I just met him and slept with him. Pow!
364.88,366.34,Mrs. Bumbry,"God, I miss one-night stands."
366.82,371.91,Elliot,"The best thing was, since I knew it was just a fling, I wasn't afraid to ask him for exactly what I wanted."
372.88,373.36,Carla,Which was?
374.18,375.71,Elliot,"Shirt on, lights off, no talking."
376.59,382.30,Carla,"Well, you just be careful. You wouldn't believe how quickly a reputation can be made in this hospital."
383.94,385.19,Mrs. Bumbry,"You're a bit of a slut, aren't you?"
394.44,398.25,Todd,"As soon as we get out of this sterile field, I am going to need the man who hit that."
399.16,400.00,Todd,To hit that!
418.75,420.22,Elliot,Wait a minute. I'm Elliott Reed.
421.63,423.97,Elliot,People! Listen up! This rumor ends right now!
425.82,427.61,Nurse Roberts,She slept with him and she hardly knew him.
428.01,429.22,Mr. Blair,Does that happen a lot around here?
429.78,430.32,Nurse Roberts,Not enough.
432.27,434.32,J.D.,"Mr. Blair, that infection keeps hanging around,"
434.40,436.33,J.D.,so I want to put you on a broader-spectrum antibiotic
436.37,437.56,J.D.,that will administer intravenously.
438.08,438.98,Mr. Blair,But I'm feeling a lot better.
440.08,441.73,J.D.,I'm gonna tell you something my mom used to tell me
441.75,442.63,J.D.,whenever I was scared.
444.36,445.88,J.D.,In the case of severe sinus infection
445.94,447.69,J.D.,"not responding to a three-day cycle of antibiotics,"
447.71,449.06,J.D.,"the recommended protocol is imipenem,"
449.21,450.70,J.D.,"500 milligrams IVQ, six hours."
452.50,453.85,J.D.,Got me through a lot of hard times.
455.73,457.20,J.D.,I love it that Mr. Blair trusted me.
457.80,459.75,J.D.,It's one of the best feelings you can have as a doctor.
460.87,461.27,Janitor,How's it going?
462.43,463.15,J.D.,You can't wear that.
463.78,464.68,Janitor,"What, you mean after Labor Day?"
465.71,466.43,J.D.,You know what I mean.
466.95,467.83,Janitor,It's a white coat.
468.42,469.56,Janitor,Anybody can wear a white coat.
471.37,471.75,J.D.,Jerk.
473.37,474.35,Janitor,You're what we call a goner.
476.56,478.13,Janitor,I'm kidding. There's nothing here.
480.55,483.45,Dr. Cox,"So Mrs. Bumbry here has inflammatory valve disease, huh?"
483.80,488.14,Carla,"Yeah, and the new drug they're testing at the clinical trial could really help her out, but of course she doesn't qualify."
488.14,488.43,Dr. Cox,Right.
488.68,489.61,Carla,"You okay, Mrs. Bumbry?"
490.07,491.69,Mrs. Bumbry,I like Bow Wow when he's little Bow Wow.
491.91,494.10,Dr. Cox,"Oh, she's right. Rappers, they grow up so fast."
494.18,498.33,Dr. Cox,"Look, Carla, if you're gonna survive in medicine, you've got to accept the fact that rules are rules."
499.43,501.32,Dr. Cox,"Hey, anyone from that clinical trial around?"
502.45,503.71,Dr. Cox,Hello? Hello?
503.71,505.38,Dr. Cox,"Yeah, this lady's supposed to be in his trial?"
506.40,507.06,Orderly,Okay.
507.06,508.36,Carla,What the hell did you just do?
508.84,512.25,Dr. Cox,"When you speak of this, and I know you will, could I be shirtless?"
512.65,515.24,Dr. Cox,"See, I think it would be even more impressive if I was shirtless."
518.53,521.51,J.D.,"Look, all I'm saying is, if you're a criminal, even if you aren't afraid of Starsky"
521.62,523.92,J.D.,if you round a corner and a tiny little hutch puppet jumps out of your face...
524.10,524.68,J.D.,"Freeze, sucka!"
524.85,525.67,J.D.,...you're done for. It's over.
525.97,527.50,Turk,Does it have a rail gun or a puppet gun?
527.67,530.10,J.D.,Puppet gun. They'd sew it to its hand.
530.70,531.59,Turk,"Okay, I'd watch that."
533.70,534.70,Turk,What's up fellas?
536.36,540.30,J.D.,"I don't care what hospital you go to, surgery is still a boys club."
546.11,547.41,J.D.,I'm just as cool as those guys.
549.15,549.69,J.D.,Bye Turk.
550.76,552.48,Todd,"T-dog, settle a little medical debate for us."
552.76,557.43,Todd,"I think Elliot's got a modest rack at best, but my favorite attending here says that when"
557.43,561.96,Todd,"he was tuning in Tokyo the other night, the reception was excellent."
563.12,565.91,Turk,"Yes, Elliot's a friend of mine, so I really don't want to talk about that, okay?"
566.21,567.14,Dr. DiStefano,"So, Dr. Turk."
568.31,569.31,Dr. DiStefano,How is your back?
571.39,573.43,Turk,"My back's as swollen as Elliot's big-ass breasts, sir."
580.17,581.21,J.D.,I was paged.
581.56,583.11,Nurse Roberts,The patient's complaining of anosmia.
584.10,585.10,Nurse Roberts,Anosmia?
586.39,590.52,J.D.,"You know, I always thought it was very funny that losing your sense of smell was called"
590.52,591.20,J.D.,anosmia.
592.93,594.25,J.D.,Anosmia.
594.25,595.92,J.D.,"You know, like schnozmia."
596.36,597.60,J.D.,Don't you find that very funny?
600.75,601.27,J.D.,He doesn't.
601.53,602.21,Nurse Roberts,I'm calling Dr. Cox.
602.41,604.16,J.D.,"Well, nobody needs to go call Dr. Cox."
604.62,605.73,Mr. Blair,"This is only temporary, right?"
605.87,606.65,J.D.,Of course it's temporary.
608.51,610.20,J.D.,Could also be slightly more untemporary.
611.10,611.74,Mr. Blair,You mean permanent.
613.88,616.97,J.D.,"Just when you think you have this place figured out, it finds a new way to get you."
618.17,619.38,Dr. Cox,I'm waiting.
621.14,625.32,Ted,"Unfortunately, you've put us in somewhat of a legal bind."
625.58,629.22,Dr. Kelso,"Way to go, Ted. My God, man, you couldn't scare a child."
630.02,630.77,Ted,Who would want to?
631.45,636.14,Dr. Kelso,"Dr. Cox, do you have any idea how much money this hospital makes from that G.I. trial"
636.14,638.35,Dr. Kelso,into which you took the liberty of enrolling your patient?
638.87,641.43,Dr. Cox,I'm gonna go ahead and guess seven dollars.
641.98,643.14,J.D.,Sometimes it comes right at you.
643.84,644.67,Dr. Kelso,"Keep smiling, tough guy."
645.71,647.42,Dr. Kelso,First I'm going to report you to the Ethics.
646.19,647.94,Dr. Cox,"Better finish that thought there, bobcat,"
647.94,649.35,Dr. Cox,because I'm not breaking my gait.
651.57,652.29,Dr. Kelso,What are you looking at?
652.54,652.90,Ted,Nothing.
656.13,657.55,J.D.,Sometimes it sneaks up on you.
658.39,659.48,Turk,"Plus, when she dated J.D.,"
659.72,661.29,Turk,she would just wear a T-shirt in the morning.
661.65,664.08,Turk,"So every time she reached up high to grab a box of cereal,"
664.42,666.51,Turk,"everybody in the room got two scoops of booty flakes,"
666.77,668.84,Turk,"and the two scoops, they were packed with flavor."
669.16,671.57,Turk,"You know what I'm saying, right?"
671.77,672.07,Turk,Right?
678.92,681.86,Mr. Blair,I told you I didn't want these antibiotics. Tell you what. When your
681.98,684.93,Mr. Blair,"first grandkid is born, you pick him up and you smell his head. Why don't you"
684.91,686.44,Mr. Blair,give me a call and tell me how great it is.
688.14,691.63,J.D.,Mr. Blair I'm really sorry this happened. And sometimes it hits you in places you didn't even know you were vulnerable.
692.00,694.28,Mr. Blair,Yeah well you should be. It's your fault
695.80,697.27,Dr. Cox,"No more silly medical mistakes, huh?"
698.49,699.17,Dr. Cox,Nice going there Newbie.
700.52,701.04,J.D.,Damn.
706.65,708.19,J.D.,"Ted, you seem different."
709.75,711.44,Ted,I bought some relaxation tapes.
713.21,713.73,Ted,They're working.
715.11,718.02,J.D.,A patient's blaming me for losing his sense of smell.
719.16,721.49,Ted,"Oh, God, you cut off someone's nose? Where is it?"
721.57,724.26,Ted,Do you have it on you? You're disgusting.
724.28,725.93,J.D.,"No, I just gave him IV imipenem."
726.21,728.98,Ted,Kelso's gonna blame me. Just get rid of the nose.
729.26,731.63,J.D.,I don't have the nose. Maybe you should just calm down.
732.27,734.12,Ted,Maybe you should calm down!
734.86,735.22,J.D.,My bad.
738.23,740.33,Ted,Imipenem. Imipenem. Imipenem.
744.30,748.72,Ted,"Unlike genomycin and tetracycline, imipenem has never been associated with anosmia."
751.05,752.16,Ted,"My God, we're okay."
752.75,753.38,Ted,We're okay.
753.77,755.33,J.D.,"Great, thank you Ted."
756.40,757.40,Ted,It's my birthday.
757.65,758.27,J.D.,What?
758.55,759.35,Ted,Nothing.
761.69,762.69,Ted,And many more
764.42,765.71,Turk,"Elliot, Elliot!"
765.71,768.46,Turk,"Come on, It's so tough to be a surgeon. If you're not in, you're out."
769.99,770.89,Dr. Amato,Dr. Turk.
772.09,773.09,Dr. Amato,Down here.
774.91,778.17,Dr. Amato,I saw you switched off on our exploratory laparotomy this afternoon.
778.33,780.22,Turk,"Yes, cuz I I I I had to do"
780.38,781.38,Dr. Amato,Because I'm short.
782.40,783.13,Turk,You're not short.
783.63,786.12,Dr. Amato,"Look, I know I'm the surgical assignment booby prize, okay?"
786.16,788.91,Dr. Amato,"But if my only other choice is being stuck in that stupid boys' club,"
788.97,790.14,Dr. Amato,I'd rather have them all make fun of me.
790.62,792.17,Turk,What could they possibly make fun of you?
792.33,792.88,Dr. Amato,Stop it.
793.67,795.66,Dr. Amato,All I'm saying is that it's possible to be a good surgeon
795.68,796.93,Dr. Amato,"without playing their game, okay?"
799.13,799.72,Turk,You're really short.
799.88,800.44,Dr. Amato,I know.
803.45,805.57,Elliot,"No, Dr. Murray, I don't want any fries to go with this shake."
806.89,808.00,Elliot,I don't even know what that means.
808.32,809.31,Noelle,"Excuse me, Dr. Reed?"
809.43,811.83,Elliot,What? What? You wanna ask me how many ceiling tiles I've counted this week?
812.25,815.16,Elliot,"Or maybe you just wanna call me a name, like Tramp or Ho or Slesident,"
815.46,817.05,Elliot,which apparently is half-slot and half-resident.
817.35,817.86,Noelle,No.
817.86,819.01,Elliot,"Then what is it, Noelle? What do you want?"
819.38,821.05,Noelle,I just wanted to know where the G-spot is.
821.06,821.61,Elliot,The what spot?
821.78,823.67,Dr. Cox,"And for the hundredth time, you're right."
823.73,826.86,Dr. Cox,You had absolutely nothing to do with me getting involved in this Mrs. Bumbry case.
826.94,830.13,Dr. Cox,"But for God's sake, Carla, the much bigger problem facing us right now"
830.19,832.40,Dr. Cox,is just exactly how do we get you to stop annoying me?
832.78,833.89,Carla,"Oh, yeah, I'm the problem."
834.41,836.82,Carla,"Look, can't you just for once stay out of your own way?"
836.92,838.57,Dr. Cox,Can't you just for once not be such a busybody?
840.19,841.86,Dr. Cox,"Oh, sore spot."
842.24,843.46,Elliot,"Uh, What spot?"
843.47,843.97,Dr. Cox,Sore spot.
844.57,845.14,Elliot,Damn it.
846.58,849.44,J.D.,"Okay, the next step is to find out what did cause Mr. Blair's loss of smell."
851.83,852.33,Janitor,"Hey, pal."
852.95,853.89,Woman #1,"Excuse me, doctor?"
854.36,856.93,Janitor,"Oh, no, I'm not a doctor. I'm a janitor."
857.29,859.30,Woman #1,"Oh, I just assumed because of the coat."
859.96,862.57,Janitor,"Right. Well, uh, janitors wear white coats around here, too."
863.27,865.58,Woman #1,"Oh, you guys do a great job keeping this place clean."
865.86,866.55,Janitor,We thank you.
866.55,867.67,J.D.,"No, I'm a doctor."
868.09,868.93,J.D.,"Look at the books, woman."
872.36,872.84,Turk,Whoa!
872.84,873.81,Turk,Is that a man's back?
874.35,877.66,Dr. DiStefano,"Hey, check out our way of assisting Dr. Rumplesurgeon."
880.09,880.58,Turk,You know what?
880.93,881.93,Turk,His name's Dr. Armato.
882.31,884.40,Turk,"And that girl you slept with, her name is Dr. Reed."
884.84,886.17,Turk,You should show them both some respect.
886.43,886.80,Dr. DiStefano,Yeah?
887.11,887.63,Dr. DiStefano,Says who?
892.11,892.51,Turk,Says me.
897.04,898.03,Carla,Dr. Kelso.
898.27,901.69,Dr. Kelso,"Carla, you look as good as I feel."
902.67,904.07,Carla,Mrs. Bumbry's 53.
904.33,906.27,Dr. Kelso,Mrs. who is what?
906.56,908.79,Carla,The patient Dr. Cox got into the GI clinical trial.
909.19,912.74,Carla,She was disqualified because her chart said she was 63 and the cutoff was 55.
913.12,915.51,Carla,But the genius who admitted her calculated her age wrong.
915.83,917.55,Carla,She's actually a perfect candidate.
918.55,920.42,Dr. Kelso,And Dr. Cox knew this?
920.78,921.42,Carla,He knew the whole time.
922.65,923.95,Dr. Kelso,Fan-damn-tastic.
925.15,927.16,Dr. Kelso,"Sweetheart, you better do the old heel-toe out of here"
927.18,928.18,Dr. Kelso,because you know as well as I do
928.26,929.53,Dr. Kelso,I'm going to take this out on somebody.
930.23,930.59,Carla,Bye-bye.
934.27,935.27,Ted,"May I, uh, join you?"
938.20,938.98,Dr. Kelso,By all means.
940.34,942.23,J.D.,"Armed with the knowledge that I was right and he was wrong,"
942.31,943.53,J.D.,I thought I'd enjoy this walk more.
944.46,945.62,J.D.,"Still, I couldn't help but empathize"
945.64,947.28,J.D.,because I've been there and I saw the signs.
948.13,949.55,J.D.,"The shameful, averted gaze."
950.53,951.50,J.D.,The nervous shifting.
952.50,956.38,J.D.,"And, of course, the wild, uncontrollable urination."
962.75,966.43,Dr. Cox,"Gosh, I'm thrilled you approve, but for the last time, I'm up here."
966.65,967.16,Dr. Cox,I'm up here.
968.12,968.76,Dr. Cox,I'm up here.
971.07,971.93,J.D.,You were wrong and I was right.
972.49,973.10,J.D.,I beg your pardon?
973.52,975.61,J.D.,Anosmia isn't a side effect of IV imipenem.
976.03,978.96,J.D.,"Plus, Mr. Blair had multiple nasal polypectomies and septoplasty,"
979.10,983.53,J.D.,and his loss of smell is most likely caused by repeated manipulation of the sinuses along with the concurrent infection.
983.93,987.04,J.D.,"So I didn't make a mistake, and you were wrong when you said, nice going, newbie."
988.40,992.77,Dr. Cox,"Here, you put me in a tough situation. I can't honestly decide whether to say"
993.39,999.04,Dr. Cox,"duh, adoy, or a very sarcastic, oh, really, my God, Fiona, I know it wasn't your fault,"
999.14,1000.69,Dr. Cox,"hell, the patient probably knows."
1001.33,1005.28,Dr. Cox,"But he seemed a little distraught, like maybe being able to blame somebody for a second or two"
1005.28,1007.89,Dr. Cox,for a second or two just might make him feel a little better and I know maybe
1008.15,1011.74,Dr. Cox,it's me but doesn't that seem like something that goes right along with
1011.82,1016.64,Dr. Cox,wearing that fancy white coat. It does doesn't it?
1018.50,1019.17,J.D.,Kind of.
1019.34,1021.80,Dr. Cox,"Gosh, I'm so proud of you. Put her there."
1028.72,1032.47,Elliot,That girl just asked me to give her my top 10 sexual positions and after the
1032.47,1034.21,Elliot,"that I know, I just started naming insects."
1035.03,1036.57,Turk,"Oh, yeah, that really sucks. I'm sorry."
1037.30,1039.16,Elliot,"I'm not sure. I mean, I was mad at you at first,"
1039.24,1041.61,Elliot,"but it's actually kind of empowering, you know,"
1041.75,1044.34,Elliot,"to have this persona, this identity."
1044.64,1046.61,Elliot,"I mean, I'm not just some, you know, nameless face"
1046.61,1047.43,Elliot,as a white doctor.
1048.49,1049.13,Elliot,Amelia Reed.
1050.52,1050.88,Elliot,Tramp.
1052.72,1054.31,Turk,"Well, that's great."
1054.85,1055.89,Turk,"If you're happy, I'm happy."
1056.56,1059.00,Elliot,"The weird thing is, she said she'd already tried stink bug."
1063.91,1066.67,J.D.,I still don't know why I was so desperate for everyone to know it wasn't my fault.
1067.65,1071.06,Carla,"Dr. Cox, Dr. Kelso has something he wants to say to you."
1072.32,1077.07,Dr. Kelso,"So, uh, I hear there was an age mix-up that I was unaware of, and, um..."
1078.12,1078.94,Dr. Kelso,"Anyway, uh..."
1080.07,1081.10,Carla,You're okay.
1081.59,1082.65,Dr. Kelso,I'm sorry.
1083.41,1085.58,J.D.,I guess it comes down to how we want to be seen by other people.
1087.50,1089.33,Dr. Cox,"I'm proud of you, Robert. Put her there."
1091.55,1096.84,Dr. Cox,"Oh, and I think it's important you understand that I had no idea how old that patient was."
1096.96,1098.89,Dr. Cox,"And for the record, she could have been 170."
1099.19,1103.39,Dr. Cox,I still would have stuck her in that trial so fast it would make your teeth fall out all over again.
1104.29,1105.00,Carla,That's perfect.
1105.46,1106.33,Dr. Cox,I would too.
1106.41,1107.65,J.D.,Some people want to be seen as the rebel.
1108.05,1108.65,Dr. Cox,"Hitting, baby."
1112.37,1114.27,J.D.,"Some people just want to be seen, period."
1118.03,1120.31,J.D.,Some people have limits on how far they'll go to protect their image.
1121.11,1122.42,Dr. Amato,"Dr. Turk, I need you down here."
1123.00,1123.34,Turk,Coming.
1126.13,1128.59,J.D.,"For me, it was when I stopped worrying about how other people saw me"
1128.63,1129.86,J.D.,that I finally started to look better.
1130.30,1134.61,J.D.,"Mr. Blair, I just wanted to say again that I made a mistake and I'm sorry."
1135.77,1136.23,Mr. Blair,It's all right.
1136.90,1137.74,J.D.,Good luck.
1139.02,1139.51,Nurse Roberts,"Come on, baby."
1140.09,1141.39,Nurse Roberts,Let's see if we can find you a ride.
1142.63,1143.39,J.D.,Laverne.
1145.66,1146.18,J.D.,Careful.
1147.74,1149.03,Janitor,"Oh, so we're done with the coats?"
1149.73,1151.69,Janitor,"Well, it was a fun day, though, wasn't it?"
1152.00,1152.48,Janitor,See you tomorrow.
1155.21,1156.91,J.D.,"You know, maybe tomorrow I'll get a bad haircut"
1156.93,1157.89,J.D.,and push around a mop all day.
1162.41,1164.13,J.D.,"I know you don't have to do it, okay?"
1166.51,1176.46,Singer Man,Mistake!
1177.37,1177.55,J.D.,Yeah.
