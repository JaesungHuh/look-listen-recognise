5.08,5.62,Turk,Who wants another beer?
5.62,6.45,Elliot,Should I have another one?
6.44,7.39,Elliot,Because I've got to work early tomorrow.
7.38,9.68,Elliot,"But I'm having fun now, except I had a pizza earlier and..."
9.49,9.97,Turk,Elliot.
10.26,10.96,Elliot,"Yes, please."
11.38,11.97,Carla,"Me too, babe."
11.98,12.82,J.D.,I'll give you a hand.
13.54,15.96,J.D.,"When you spend most of your time together as a part of a group,"
15.96,18.25,J.D.,"if you're left alone, it can get pretty awkward."
18.70,21.39,J.D.,There can be uncomfortable silences.
23.41,25.25,Elliot,Th-th-that-that was my tummy.
26.28,26.66,Carla,Oh.
27.44,27.94,Carla,RIght.
29.15,31.73,Dr. Kelso,"Dr. Murphy, describe the presentation of Ludwig's angina."
32.46,32.82,Doug,Uh..
32.51,34.88,J.D.,"Still, it's nothing compared to the silence you can hear at work."
36.56,37.59,Dr. Kelso,"Proud to have you on board, son."
38.61,40.74,Dr. Kelso,"Anyway, I'm sending one of you to an AMA conference,"
40.78,43.25,Dr. Kelso,"where you're going to eat free food, stay at a nice hotel,"
43.49,45.92,Dr. Kelso,and try your darndest not to embarrass this hospital.
46.34,48.37,Dr. Kelso,"And in the interest of fairness, I drew a name out of a hat,"
48.63,50.17,Dr. Kelso,and that name was Elliot Reed.
50.64,52.63,Elliot,Yes! I never wanted anything!
53.17,53.99,Dr. Kelso,"And then I thought,"
54.42,55.61,Dr. Kelso,"oh, who cares what I thought?"
55.60,56.82,Dr. Kelso,"The point is, you're not going."
58.02,64.54,Dr. Kelso,"You see, it seems as though all you lazybones have forgotten my edict about residents publishing case reports."
64.88,68.57,Dr. Kelso,That's why I've decided that whoever brings me the most interesting case gets the ticket to Reno.
69.25,71.10,Doug,"You know, sir, my parents live in Reno."
71.44,73.97,Dr. Kelso,"Well, that's just great, sport. I'm sure you'll see them over Christmas."
77.65,78.64,Dr. Kelso,Crime indeed.
79.38,81.95,J.D.,There aren't many things that can make the chief of medicine move that fast.
82.45,87.22,J.D.,But whenever we get a patient who has the same name as a wing of the hospital you can pretty much predict Kelso's behavior
87.76,92.61,Dr. Kelso,"Would you like it high up on the cheek, or do you prefer this fleshy part in the middle?"
96.23,100.10,Mrs. Warner,I'm trying to decide who's the most detestable suck up here you?
100.68,101.96,Mrs. Warner,This feminine guy with a perm?
102.33,103.60,Guy With Perm,"Mom, please!"
103.78,106.82,Mrs. Warner,Or the one in the corner who can't seem to stop daydreaming.
113.95,114.95,J.D.,"I'm sorry, what?"
115.69,117.24,Mrs. Warner,"Oh, great, another sycophant."
117.53,121.62,Dr. Cox,"Listen up, there, Molly Menopause. I need you to quiet the hell down you're scaring everyone in the"
121.61,125.20,Dr. Cox,hospital I mean my god. They're delivering a baby upstairs and the poor
125.20,127.78,Dr. Cox,kids using the umbilical cord to crawl the hell back in now you listen to me
127.77,128.74,Mrs. Warner,Now you listen to me.
130.03,130.72,Dr. Cox,"I mean it, sister."
131.92,133.76,Mrs. Warner,"Okay. From now on, he's my doctor."
133.82,135.27,Mrs. Warner,The rest of you can get the hell out of here.
135.87,136.13,Dr. Cox,Scram.
138.56,138.75,J.D.,Wait.
140.56,141.66,J.D.,Is that easy to manage?
143.75,147.24,Singer,I can't do this all on my own
147.59,150.00,Singer,"No, I know I'm no Superman"
153.69,154.91,Singer,I'm no Superman
157.61,162.96,Dr. Cox,"Okay, I'm Dr. Cox, this is my gal, Friday, she'll be helping me to take care of you,"
163.08,167.03,Dr. Cox,"but before we get underway, we're gonna need you to ease up on the yakety-yak."
167.21,169.24,Mrs. Warner,"You can drop the macho act now, dear, they're gone."
169.56,171.25,Dr. Cox,"Yak, schmack, the lips stay zipped."
171.43,172.13,J.D.,Zipped schmipped.
172.79,173.57,J.D.,"Oh, I thought we were riffing."
173.74,174.24,Dr. Cox,"Yeah, we're not."
174.28,174.48,J.D.,Okay.
174.94,176.01,Mrs. Warner,"Well, aren't you delicious?"
176.49,179.65,Mrs. Warner,"You know, if I were 20 years younger and slightly tipsy, this might be your lucky day."
180.25,181.38,Dr. Cox,"Careful there, sweet cheeks."
181.86,184.53,Dr. Cox,I haven't decided which way. I'm going to take your temperature yet.
186.65,188.86,J.D.,Wow. She had some real old-fashioned sass.
189.12,190.93,J.D.,"I mean, you just don't see sass like that anymore."
190.95,192.11,Dr. Cox,Stop saying sass.
192.75,193.12,J.D.,Sass?
193.64,194.00,Doug,Um...
195.04,197.57,Doug,"Dr. Cox, I have a patient with blennorrhea,"
197.73,201.33,Doug,and I was wondering if you thought that was interesting enough to present to Dr. Kelso.
202.46,205.65,Dr. Cox,"Gosh, I'm sorry, nervous guy, but I just can't do your work for you."
206.03,208.02,Dr. Cox,But what do you say you head on down to the library
208.02,210.47,Dr. Cox,and look it up in the New England Journal of Who Gives a Rat's Ass?
210.87,214.30,Dr. Cox,"You've got to leave this instant, this second, this moment. Just go."
215.80,216.16,Dr. Cox,Boy.
216.55,217.17,Dr. Cox,"But tell me this, Muffin."
217.87,223.76,Dr. Cox,You're not gonna be like all these other mindless drones trying to turn the sniffles into something much more fascinating
223.82,226.61,Dr. Cox,"just so you're the one who selected to go to this stupid conference, are you?"
227.57,228.62,J.D.,I felt I knew the right answer.
230.41,230.78,J.D.,No?
231.45,232.44,Dr. Cox,"Oh, good girl."
234.97,235.88,Dr. Kelso,Nurse Roberts.
236.28,239.84,Dr. Kelso,I just saw your patient in 106 and I've decided that the next time you
239.84,243.79,Dr. Kelso,"place an IV and actually hit the vein on the first try, I'm going to crack open a bottle"
243.81,244.17,Dr. Kelso,of bubbly.
244.75,248.78,Dr. Kelso,"I mean, my God, woman, the man looks like Al Jarreau was his nurse."
249.86,250.28,Nurse Roberts,What?
251.19,252.03,Dr. Kelso,Isn't he the blind fellow?
253.03,254.06,Nurse Roberts,You mean Ray Charles?
254.48,254.94,Dr. Kelso,Damn it.
255.28,256.91,Dr. Kelso,"Anyway, you're incompetent."
257.90,258.70,Nurse Roberts,"Easy, Laverne."
259.70,260.75,Nurse Roberts,You're a saved woman.
261.03,261.57,Carla,Don't worry.
262.00,263.33,Carla,Remember tomorrow's his wedding anniversary.
264.02,265.02,Elliot,Why does that matter?
265.19,268.86,Dr. Cox,"Cause right about tomorrow, Bob Kelso will be sweeter than flowers dipped in honey."
269.33,271.51,Dr. Wen,Which is why every year we use this time
271.51,276.64,Dr. Wen,as an opportunity to ask him for anything our department needs. Like equipment.
276.81,278.75,Carla,Or an extra nurse on weekends.
278.96,281.04,Todd,Or a slip and slide. Who's with me?
281.44,282.04,Woman Doctor #1,shut up.
282.73,283.73,Turk,I don't get it Dr. Wen.
283.91,287.11,Turk,Why would Kelso's anniversary make him less of a jerk than usual?
287.62,292.18,Dr. Wen,"Well tonight after work, Dr. Kelso will take his wife to a candlelit dinner."
292.44,294.07,Dr. Wen,"Then, after they've toasted"
294.09,295.83,Dr. Wen,"to 40 wonderful years together,"
296.57,299.33,Dr. Wen,"they'll go home and, oh, bam, oh, bam."
299.66,301.05,Carla,I actually think it's really sweet
301.05,302.24,Carla,"that at their age they still,"
302.24,303.92,Dr. Cox,"Bam, bam, bam, bam."
303.92,306.15,Turk,"And then bam, Dr. Wen points to me"
306.21,307.67,Turk,and now guess who has to go ask Dr. Kelso
307.79,309.26,Turk,for a new Argon laser tomorrow?
309.78,310.70,Carla,"I'm sorry, baby."
311.35,312.27,Turk,I'm outta here.
314.27,315.54,Turk,Damn argon laser.
316.04,317.11,Elliot,"Carla, do you think we'd hang out as much"
317.15,318.15,Elliot,if it weren't for JD and Turk?
318.87,320.17,Carla,"Uh, probably not."
321.13,322.74,Carla,"I mean, they are the one thing we have most in common."
323.26,324.09,Elliot,We have a lot in common.
324.15,325.83,Elliot,"I mean, we both have a hard time digesting dairy."
326.65,327.19,Carla,You're right.
327.24,328.28,Carla,Do you want to be my maid of honor?
329.48,331.85,Carla,"Elliot, I don't know why you're trying to force this."
331.91,332.57,Carla,We're fine.
334.13,334.88,Carla,I've got to get back to work.
337.46,338.62,Elliot,We both work.
340.69,343.03,Doug,So have you found any cool cases yet?
343.33,345.40,J.D.,"Look, muffin, I'm not going to run around this hospital"
345.44,347.44,J.D.,like the rest of you mindless drones trying
347.44,350.44,J.D.,to turn the sniffles into something fastening just so you can go to some stupid conference.
352.04,352.71,J.D.,Schmonference.
353.21,354.09,J.D.,"It's fun, the rhyme."
354.87,356.84,Elliot,What's stupid? It's an amazing networking opportunity.
357.70,359.57,Elliot,"Doesn't matter though, because I've got it wrapped up anyway."
359.93,361.80,Doug,Why? Do you have something better than my guy with blennorrhea?
362.36,363.98,Elliot,"Doug, if I told you, you would not believe it."
367.17,369.39,Elliot,"And as you can see, the ass is on the front."
373.05,373.58,Man Doctor #2,Bravo!
375.27,376.07,J.D.,Front butt.
376.75,377.79,J.D.,It's like the grail.
378.21,380.78,Elliot,"Did you say something, mister, too scared to get in the game?"
381.58,382.59,J.D.,Don't get sucked in.
383.19,384.67,J.D.,"You know, I have an interesting patient, too."
386.13,391.11,J.D.,"So basically, Mr. Davis, you received a blunt trauma to the fibrous tissue of the corpus cavernosum."
391.79,392.91,Mike,"Great, and that means..."
393.53,394.41,J.D.,You broke your penis.
395.96,396.35,Mike,Wow.
396.76,399.31,Mike,I can't wait to get my cast signed.
400.07,402.42,J.D.,"I gotta tell you, it's such an unusual case."
402.58,405.43,J.D.,Would you mind if I try and get it published in a medical journal?
406.29,407.86,Mike,That would be fantastic.
408.48,409.61,J.D.,I'll let you mull it over.
410.97,412.15,J.D.,"And smile, Mr. Davis."
413.45,414.89,J.D.,Tomorrow's gonna be a better day...
416.66,417.37,J.D.,For everyone.
431.48,433.10,Nurse #1,"Dr. Kelso, happy anniversary."
434.58,434.99,Nurse #1,Oh.
437.18,438.43,Nurse #2,"Excuse me, sir."
441.85,442.22,Male Nurse,Sir.
442.94,443.60,Male Nurse,Whoa!
450.87,453.09,Elliot,"Carla, I figured out why we don't hang out more."
453.63,454.52,Carla,"That's great, Elliot."
454.64,455.56,Carla,"Pins and needles, really."
455.64,457.29,Carla,But I'm prepping a patient for surgery here.
457.45,458.62,Elliot,"Oh, Miss Kellerman's my patient, too."
459.12,460.16,Elliot,I trade with Doug so we could talk.
460.52,461.48,Mrs. Kellerman,"Oh, are you two friends?"
462.41,462.95,Elliot,We're about to be.
463.65,464.45,Carla,"Oh, my god."
464.97,466.54,Elliot,"You're still stuck on your first impression of me,"
466.62,468.97,Elliot,"that I am some narrow-minded, spoiled brat."
469.15,470.15,Carla,"Elliot, not now, OK?"
473.03,474.53,Elliot,"When I was a kid, I was really close with my maid."
474.63,474.99,Carla,That's it.
477.37,479.85,Carla,So you think that you totally get my whole experience
479.89,481.58,Carla,because you spent time with the Latina woman
481.62,482.52,Carla,who cleaned your house?
482.52,483.55,Elliot,What are you talking about?
483.55,484.17,Elliot,Our maid was white.
484.85,485.37,Carla,What was her name?
489.71,490.09,Elliot,Consuela.
491.21,492.71,Elliot,"Look, you know that I don't always say the right thing,"
492.74,494.08,Elliot,but you also know how hard I'm trying.
494.43,495.13,Elliot,"So yeah, I guess you're right."
495.17,497.12,Elliot,"We have nothing in common, because I only have things"
497.12,498.18,Elliot,in common with nice people.
498.31,499.02,Carla,"Oh, so"
498.64,501.05,Mrs. Kellerman,"You two realize I can still hear you, right?"
503.33,503.75,Carla,Hi.
503.34,503.75,Elliot,Hi.
507.89,510.11,Dr. Kelso,"Dr. Carlson, the pediatrics needs a new bronchoscope."
510.15,513.10,Dr. Kelso,You're gonna get one. Love to the wife and kidlets. Who's next?
514.40,515.91,Janitor,"Hey, do me a favor. Hold my place in line."
516.63,517.07,J.D.,For how long?
518.13,518.46,Janitor,I don't know.
519.08,520.43,J.D.,"Well, why? What do you have to do?"
522.03,523.36,Janitor,Nothing. I might just veg.
525.95,527.77,J.D.,"No, seriously, try me. I can do it with anything."
527.97,528.72,Nurse Roberts,Go away.
528.72,529.30,J.D.,Go Shmey.
529.62,531.11,Nurse Roberts,All right. Try this one.
531.23,533.72,Dr. Cox,"Angie, put on your flats. We're going for a walk."
533.93,535.02,J.D.,Eat Schmidt and die.
535.66,537.53,J.D.,"Around here, life can be full of surprises."
538.37,539.84,J.D.,Some are as simple as forgetting something
539.86,540.80,J.D.,you were supposed to ask for.
541.32,541.82,Turk,Dr. Kelso!
543.50,544.24,Turk,Is he gone?
545.30,545.82,Turk,Huh.
547.98,549.54,J.D.,Some are so unexpected that everything else
549.54,550.36,J.D.,takes a back seat.
551.79,552.81,Elliot,"I'm sorry, Mrs. Kellerman."
552.89,554.53,Elliot,I don't even know what kind of surgery you're having.
555.04,556.51,Mrs. Kellerman,"I'm getting big, fake breasts."
558.63,560.48,J.D.,And some you'd never thought you'd hear.
560.68,564.11,Dr. Cox,"Listen, Newby, I don't tell you I respect you a lot because, well, I don't."
564.65,564.88,J.D.,I know.
565.32,569.12,Dr. Cox,"I gotta say, the fact that you're not jumping through Kelso's hoops like the rest of these peons,"
569.24,572.73,Dr. Cox,"yes, you, forever you, a thousand times you, move."
574.81,577.88,Dr. Cox,"Anyway, let's make pretend it's your birthday or something because I'm..."
579.59,580.57,Dr. Cox,"Oh, hell, I'm impressed."
581.17,581.91,Dr. Cox,Let's get some coffee.
583.22,583.80,J.D.,This is great.
584.14,585.01,J.D.,There's only one problem.
585.57,586.71,J.D.,"You see, ten minutes ago..."
587.25,589.46,Mike,What the hell? Go ahead and use me in your case report.
589.84,590.94,J.D.,I'm going to Reno!
591.19,593.49,J.D.,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
595.87,596.43,Dr. Cox,"Beg your pardon, Newbie?"
597.45,598.12,Dr. Cox,What are you thinking?
599.64,600.35,J.D.,Not about Reno.
601.11,601.81,Dr. Cox,Thatta girl. Let's go.
611.71,613.13,J.D.,With every sip of the coffee
613.15,615.62,J.D.,"that Dr. Cox bought me, I could taste my own hypocrisy."
617.66,619.31,J.D.,Thank God my hypocrisy missed me.
620.73,622.48,Janitor,The reason I wanted you to stand in line for me
622.50,623.60,Janitor,is because I needed a new mop.
624.35,626.17,Janitor,Your floors are all slippery because this one doesn't work.
626.79,627.60,Janitor,You know why it doesn't work?
628.54,629.51,J.D.,It's out of mop gas?
630.25,630.33,Janitor,No.
631.23,632.91,Janitor,Because it's so old it won't soak up water.
633.62,633.84,Janitor,See?
635.79,637.85,J.D.,Something in that filthy mop water woke me up.
638.91,640.66,J.D.,"I decided I could have my cake and eat it, too."
642.48,643.81,J.D.,Dr. Cox would never know.
644.27,646.36,Dr. Cox,"What do you say there, Bridge Club? How you feeling?"
646.52,648.51,Mrs. Warner,I feel like crap. What the hell's wrong with me?
648.81,651.25,Dr. Cox,"Your abdominal pain suggests you have biliary disease,"
651.34,654.48,Dr. Cox,"but all your tests came back negative, so we don't exactly know what's wrong with you."
654.96,657.27,J.D.,"But don't worry, Dr. Cox and I never say die."
657.97,661.66,J.D.,"But unless, of course, someone actually dies, then we're kind of forced to by law."
662.04,662.97,Mrs. Warner,He's talking again.
663.29,665.03,Dr. Cox,"Oh, come on. The kid's okay."
665.93,667.44,J.D.,The kid? This is great.
668.00,669.77,Mrs. Warner,So why haven't I heard your name before?
670.11,674.76,J.D.,"Well, I've only been here a year, and he's actually just started calling me the kid, which I love, by the way."
674.86,675.99,Dr. Cox,"She's talking to me, pumpkin."
675.99,676.21,J.D.,Okay.
676.21,679.17,Mrs. Warner,"Seriously, you should be more than just an attending. Let me make a phone call."
679.46,681.31,Dr. Cox,I'm not so good with handouts.
681.55,683.37,Mrs. Warner,"Oh, come on. I'm only putting in a good word."
683.61,685.98,Dr. Cox,"I'll tell you what there, Bubby. If you really want to help me,"
685.98,690.07,Dr. Cox,"why don't you quiet down and get yourself some rest, and then if you're a really good girl,"
690.27,692.86,Dr. Cox,I'll wind up your car and take you out to a talkie.
694.75,696.49,Mrs. Warner,"Oh, I could do naughty things to that man."
697.57,698.52,J.D.,Uncomfortable.
701.51,702.77,Elliot,You're getting fake breasts?
703.22,703.86,Mrs. Kellerman,Stripper big.
704.28,705.35,Carla,"Forgive me, Mrs. Kellerman,"
705.39,707.92,Carla,but why would you wait until now to do this?
708.38,709.77,Elliot,"You know, because you're so old."
710.01,711.15,Carla,"Yeah, Elliot, she gets that."
711.48,713.38,Elliot,"Yeah, I know. I'm sure she gets it all the time."
714.42,716.59,Mrs. Kellerman,"Look, I've been self-conscious my whole life,"
716.75,718.03,Mrs. Kellerman,and I finally got the courage.
718.82,720.42,Mrs. Kellerman,"Besides, can you two honestly say"
720.48,722.65,Mrs. Kellerman,there's not one thing you'd change about yourself if you could?
723.75,724.70,Carla,I can honestly say that.
724.98,725.22,Elliot,Me too.
726.02,727.17,Mrs. Kellerman,Then you're both liars.
727.91,730.94,Todd,"Hey, Mrs. K, let's get you into a fresh pair of blouse bunnies."
732.98,736.39,Turk,"To hell with this ""there's only one day to ask Kelso for stuff."""
736.77,738.61,Turk,"Shoot, I'm getting that argon laser today."
743.41,747.60,Singer #2,What a difference a day make
751.36,754.33,Singer #2,Twenty four little hours
754.15,754.67,Man Doctor #1,Dr. Kelso.
758.51,759.52,Turk,"Hey, Dr. Kelso."
762.09,762.96,Turk,So uncool.
764.47,765.24,Dr. Kelso,What?
765.24,765.88,Turk,Nothing.
769.10,769.69,Dr. Kelso,And you?
769.69,771.65,J.D.,"Nothing, sir. I don't want anything from you ever."
771.65,773.36,Dr. Kelso,"You know, that's what my son always says."
774.07,777.72,Dr. Kelso,"But then when Mother's Day rolls around, guess who wants me to go halvsies on a pasta pot for Enid?"
777.72,778.42,J.D.,"But, sir, I..."
778.43,779.82,Dr. Kelso,"She's not my mother, damn it!"
780.32,784.75,Dr. Kelso,Oh.  And don't think that I've forgotten that you have yet to turn in a case report.
785.11,785.83,Dr. Kelso,You have until six.
787.53,788.72,J.D.,You can't just change your mind.
789.72,792.39,Mike,"I'm sorry, did I pass out from the pain in my penis"
792.45,794.36,Mike,and suddenly we're not in America anymore?
795.92,796.75,J.D.,Crap.
798.31,798.72,Janitor,What's this?
799.85,800.25,J.D.,It's a mop.
800.75,801.63,Janitor,"Yeah, I got that."
802.32,803.16,Janitor,"I mean, why'd you get it from me?"
804.15,805.64,J.D.,Because I thought it would be nice.
806.69,807.31,J.D.,"Why, don't you like it?"
810.27,810.80,J.D.,Well?
812.66,813.33,Janitor,Huh.
813.86,814.30,Janitor,Hmm.
821.24,822.08,Janitor,Hang on.
822.27,824.49,Turk,"Man, today could not get any worse."
825.22,828.52,Carla,"If you were to change one thing about my physical appearance, what would it be?"
829.42,831.27,Turk,You're testing me. I get it.
831.71,835.02,Carla,"Baby, you know I don't like you talking to God while we're trying to have a discussion."
835.18,835.72,Turk,Mmm-hmm.
836.08,841.05,Carla,"Now if I were to be really honest with myself, I would change everything"
842.80,843.58,Carla,What do you think?
844.55,847.76,Turk,Why don't we just skip what I think and jump right ahead to not having sex for a month
850.23,851.61,Turk,Are all women is crazy?
852.77,853.52,Elliot,I hate my cheeks.
854.11,854.91,Elliot,Suck them in.
855.36,856.19,Elliot,I'll take some of that.
856.73,860.57,Elliot,"Oh, that's right, work it, baby. Mm. Now you're smoking."
862.23,863.03,Elliot,God I'm hideous
864.45,867.60,Dr. Cox,Good news Mrs. Warner. I think we got a pretty good idea what's going on in there.
867.89,871.21,J.D.,So I don't have a case to present. At least this way we get to stay a team
871.59,875.98,Dr. Cox,anyway it turns out the EGD showed multiple erosive peptic ulcers and the
876.04,879.59,Dr. Cox,secretin injection test was positive all of which suggests that you have
879.67,881.72,Dr. Cox,gastrinominous zolingeral syndrome.
882.10,883.74,Mrs. Warner,"In english, please."
883.74,888.37,Dr. Cox,Your stomach acid is eroding your own intestines. It's remarkable I've never actually seen
888.55,890.27,Dr. Cox,anything like it before. Newbie you?
891.89,894.44,J.D.,"No,. And that's when I realized Mrs. Warner was"
894.44,895.83,J.D.,the most interesting case in the hospital.
896.14,897.14,Dr. Cox,Whole thing is very treatable.
897.57,899.67,Dr. Cox,We're gonna step outside then we'll get underway. How's that sound?
901.48,902.48,Dr. Cox,"Newbie, what do you say?"
902.47,903.72,J.D.,I just had to go for it.
903.95,907.10,J.D.,"Actually if you just give me a second, I want to ask Mrs. Warner something."
907.51,908.11,Dr. Cox,What?
909.40,910.40,J.D.,To marry me?
911.08,912.78,Dr. Cox,"Come on, heel, toe, what do you say, kid?"
918.67,919.25,Dr. Cox,Come on.
921.17,923.98,J.D.,"Mrs. Warner, I was wondering if you'd give me permission to present your case"
924.08,925.87,J.D.,to possibly be published in a national medical journal
925.91,927.63,J.D.,so that I might be chosen to go to an AMA conference.
928.94,929.38,Mrs. Warner,"Sure, why not?"
930.99,931.47,J.D.,Thanks.
932.91,933.58,J.D.,Excuse me.
939.17,941.94,Turk,"Excuse me, Dr. Kelso, could I have a minute of your time?"
942.42,946.85,Dr. Kelso,"Oh, for God's sake, son, I have two more days in peace before my wife returns from frat camp."
947.08,951.84,Turk,"Look, I need an argon laser, and I was gonna ask you yesterday, but then all of a..."
952.32,952.77,Turk,Hold up.
953.59,955.51,Turk,How can you make love to your wife if she's at that camp?
955.89,958.90,Dr. Kelso,The real question is how can I make love to her when she's not at frat camp?
959.62,960.63,Turk,"Sir, you lied to us."
961.17,962.41,Dr. Kelso,"Hi, I'm Bob Kelso."
962.57,963.13,Dr. Kelso,Nice to meet you.
964.40,964.80,Dr. Kelso,Looks good.
965.32,969.45,Dr. Kelso,"If people think I'm only giving once a year, they'll only be asking me for things once"
969.45,969.77,Dr. Kelso,Capiche?
970.15,971.10,Dr. Kelso,Now get out of my eyeline.
971.18,972.94,Dr. Kelso,Nurse Tisdale's wearing ankle socks today.
975.49,976.21,Turk,How about I don't?
977.19,979.84,Turk,"And how about you help me out, and I won't tell anybody about this."
980.78,985.49,Turk,Unless you like it when people come and ask you for stuff like every single day.
987.00,987.39,Dr. Kelso,Mm.
990.05,990.57,Dr. Kelso,Frat camp.
991.67,992.89,Dr. Kelso,Six years she's been going there.
992.93,994.64,Dr. Kelso,The only thing getting any thinner is my wallet.
1000.14,1001.14,Elliot,Is J.D here?
1002.17,1002.87,Carla,"No, it's just me."
1004.05,1006.82,Elliot,"Oh, um, I guess I'll just wait till."
1007.74,1007.96,Carla,Crap.
1008.67,1009.53,Elliot,"Fine, I'll wait outside."
1009.91,1010.24,Carla,No.
1010.99,1012.13,Carla,Just talking to my hair.
1013.22,1015.43,Carla,"I mean, if it's even the least bit humid, all of a sudden"
1015.43,1016.01,Carla,I'm Dr. J.
1017.21,1017.98,Elliot,Is he in radiology?
1020.53,1020.77,Carla,Yeah.
1024.92,1027.13,Elliot,"Carla, you know, I would kill for your hair."
1028.31,1028.53,Carla,Really?
1029.30,1029.48,Elliot,Yeah.
1031.36,1032.33,Carla,I would kill for your legs.
1033.03,1034.05,Elliot,I would kill for your lips.
1034.59,1036.05,Carla,I'd kill for that wagon you're dragging.
1038.27,1038.85,Carla,That's your butt.
1039.35,1040.39,Elliot,"Oh, thank you."
1042.55,1043.05,Elliot,Wagon?
1043.79,1044.50,Carla,Dragging.
1045.80,1051.66,J.D.,"I won! Thank you, Mrs. Warner, in your face, in your face, in your..."
1054.13,1054.63,J.D.,...face.
1055.09,1056.09,Dr. Cox,Congratulations.
1057.07,1060.64,Dr. Cox,You get to represent the Kelso Kennel Club at the big show in Reno.
1061.70,1064.63,Dr. Cox,"Just remember, when you are posing and prancing in front of the judges,"
1064.71,1069.52,Dr. Cox,"to keep that shaved behind of yours held up nice and high, like the proud little puppy that you are."
1070.58,1076.23,Dr. Cox,"When it comes time to hand out those blue ribbons, it'll be such an exciting time for you, it really will be, but for the love of God it'll be..."
1077.26,1080.46,Dr. Cox,"You've got to try, try, try not to squeeze out a dookie on the astroturf."
1081.36,1082.11,Dr. Cox,"Because, uh,"
1083.51,1086.60,Dr. Cox,"I mean, God forbid you were ever an embarrassment to Master Bob, right?"
1088.87,1089.85,J.D.,"You know, I don't care what you think."
1091.49,1092.08,Dr. Cox,"Yeah, you do."
1092.80,1093.04,J.D.,I know.
1096.90,1101.53,J.D.,"Look, I want to be like you, but a more successful you."
1103.25,1104.96,J.D.,There's nothing wrong with playing the game once in a while.
1107.39,1110.35,J.D.,"Tell you what, ten years from now when I'm your boss, I'll go ahead and throw in a good"
1110.39,1111.84,J.D.,"word for you, and you won't even have to ask."
1115.27,1115.77,J.D.,Sir.
1121.83,1124.68,J.D.,I like to think that your life comes down to the choices you've made along the way.
1127.30,1129.33,J.D.,"Like the choice to stand up to a superior,"
1135.57,1138.54,J.D.,or choice to focus on what you have in common instead of what you don't.
1138.92,1145.42,Singer #3,"Just leave it, because you're not in control no more."
1145.46,1146.32,Singer #3,But you give it all away.
1147.24,1149.27,J.D.,Or the choice to let someone help you for once.
1149.39,1152.38,Singer #3,Would you give it all away now?
1153.61,1154.95,Singer #3,Let it come apart.
1155.93,1157.67,J.D.,"In the end, you just have to trust your decisions."
1158.35,1159.39,Todd,You hear the husband?
1159.86,1161.15,Todd,We've got to get you some bigger hands.
1161.33,1163.23,J.D.,"And hopefully, you'll land on solid ground."
1166.22,1167.30,J.D.,"Well, what about your new mop?"
1168.16,1168.96,Janitor,I like my old one.
1169.93,1170.71,J.D.,But you cried.
1171.64,1172.52,Janitor,"No, that was you."
1173.82,1174.35,Janitor,No!
1175.88,1176.80,J.D.,It's a good one.
