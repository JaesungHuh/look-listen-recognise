2.60,9.92,J.D.,"Mr. Hogan, I can't stress enough how much you got to avoid the red meat. The cirrhosis of your liver is preventing it from filtering out all the toxins, and"
9.98,13.95,J.D.,"if those get to your brain, you become encephalopathic, leading to a mental status change."
14.59,17.10,Mr. Hogan,"So what, am I going to start acting all crazy or something?"
17.10,19.11,J.D.,You'll need a tinfoil hat to hold in all your thoughts.
19.55,21.99,Mr. Hogan,"Then I can still have a tiny little bite of my wife's carne asada, right?"
22.70,22.93,J.D.,Well...
23.72,26.93,J.D.,The greatest thing about Carla is I always know I can count on her to be the bad cop.
28.23,29.88,Carla,What part of no meat don't you understand?
30.14,30.92,Carla,I just thought that I'll...
31.52,31.81,J.D.,Carla?
33.17,36.31,Carla,"So, if you don't listen to Dr. Dorian, you're gonna have to answer to me."
36.98,38.43,Mr. Hogan,"Okay, Ix-nay on the eat-may."
38.45,38.93,Carla,That's right.
39.35,40.13,J.D.,We're a team.
42.14,42.75,Carla,What?
43.28,44.45,J.D.,Eat-may sounds like eat-me.
46.17,48.20,J.D.,"Of course, on some teams, there's gonna be friction."
48.78,49.32,Dr. Wen,All right.
49.79,50.37,Dr. Wen,We're done here.
51.99,52.66,Dr. Wen,"Bonnie, you close?"
53.16,53.51,Turk,Damn.
54.25,55.40,Bonnie,"Aw, don't be mad."
55.40,58.47,Bonnie,Just be the good little beeyotch you are and wipe the sweat off my forehead.
58.83,61.02,Turk,"Look, don't say biatch. You can't pull it off."
61.50,65.15,Turk,"Which is interesting, being that you're the queen mother of all."
65.51,68.00,Bonnie,"Dr. Wen, my forehead's feeling a little misty."
68.86,70.71,Dr. Wen,"Dr. Turk, are your hands broken?"
71.21,71.64,Turk,No.
73.71,74.15,Turk,Here you go.
75.07,76.46,Bonnie,"Mmm, that's nice."
77.92,78.29,Bonnie,Biatch.
81.03,83.98,J.D.,"And some teams, well, they never really seem to get together."
84.52,86.46,Elliot,"Dr. Cox, I'm so glad I caught you. We need"
85.77,88.67,Dr. Cox,"And there it is again, that ringing in my ears."
88.73,91.26,Dr. Cox,"It's kind of an ah, but it's more piercing."
91.26,94.44,Dr. Cox,"It's more of an ee, ee, ee, ee."
94.44,95.32,J.D.,She's trying to ask you a question.
95.78,100.32,Dr. Cox,"Now, Hugh, you're more of a low-pitched ooga, ooga, ooga."
100.34,102.27,Dr. Cox,"It's more masculine, which, quite frankly,"
102.27,105.06,Dr. Cox,"is surprising considering the source, but make no mistake,"
105.32,107.25,Dr. Cox,"oh, just equally annoying."
107.26,108.02,Dr. Cox,"Luckily, though,"
108.85,110.72,Dr. Cox,I know how to make the pain go away.
112.52,114.22,Dr. Cox,"Ah, much better."
114.75,115.89,Elliot,Can you believe that?
115.88,117.09,Elliot,"I mean, every time we even try to talk to him,"
117.09,118.81,Elliot,he starts going off on all these random dances and monologues.
118.84,123.28,Dr. Cox,"Hee, hee, hee, hee, hee."
121.69,122.38,Elliot,You know?
123.29,124.00,Elliot,You know?
124.64,126.06,J.D.,"Clearly, we're on the same page."
126.78,127.65,Elliot,We're residents now.
127.69,129.08,Elliot,"We should be treated more like colleagues,"
129.16,131.03,Elliot,and I can't even get him to notice me.
132.97,133.35,Elliot,"Oh, God!"
134.40,134.91,Elliot,Oh!
135.60,136.66,Elliot,"Sorry, sorry, sorry."
143.71,144.41,Dr. Cox,Okay.
151.94,153.38,J.D.,Maybe if you wore your hair up.
156.26,159.52,Singer,I can't do this all on my own
159.53,160.28,Singer,"No, I know."
160.99,162.36,Singer,I'm no superman.
165.78,167.50,Singer,I'm no superman.
172.03,172.63,Janitor,What's up.
173.72,174.97,J.D.,Be careful here.
175.83,177.46,J.D.,"Don't give him, anything."
178.25,180.28,J.D.,"Nothing. What is up with you, man?"
180.97,183.91,Janitor,I always get this way in the fall you know. Summer's gone the days are
183.91,187.44,Janitor,"shorter this makes me feel so, what's word?"
189.15,189.68,J.D.,Sad?
190.27,191.27,Janitor,Yes. That's it.
192.08,197.78,Janitor,I'm a janitor. I couldn't think of the word sad I was gonna say it makes me feel so mop.
198.07,198.97,J.D.,Let me explain it.
199.13,199.72,Janitor,Go ahead.
200.07,200.89,Janitor,I'm mopping.
201.52,202.35,J.D.,Maybe I shouldn't bother.
202.35,203.35,Janitor,Maybe you mopn't.
204.71,207.18,J.D.,I guess after a while you just stop being surprised by people.
207.54,210.25,Mr. Hogan,"Yeah, I'm going to be needing a room"
211.65,213.66,Mr. Hogan,Who can say no to 49 cent cheeseburgers?
213.66,214.33,Carla,Sure
214.33,219.58,Carla,but check on the cost of medicine in your room and pumping your stomach and that 49 cent cheeseburgers gonna run you in the neighborhood
219.58,221.08,Carla,"of $1,300."
221.08,222.36,Mr. Hogan,"Huh. See, that's how they get you."
222.35,222.96,Carla,That's right.
223.80,225.18,Nurse Roberts,"Carly, your brother called."
225.18,225.68,Carla,"Oh, cool."
225.68,226.49,J.D.,I didn't know you had a brother.
227.25,228.18,Carla,That's my pet name for Turk.
228.86,230.55,Carla,"You know, because he's mine and he's a black man."
231.17,231.61,Carla,My brother.
232.17,233.44,J.D.,That is adorable.
233.58,234.84,J.D.,Do you think he'd mind if I called him that too?
234.91,236.19,Carla,"JD, I was kidding."
236.65,236.87,J.D.,I know.
237.95,238.62,J.D.,I'm still going to ask.
241.17,242.39,J.D.,How come I don't know anything about your family?
243.01,243.35,Carla,I don't know.
244.00,246.12,Carla,I'm just not big on sharing my personal life with people.
246.94,248.29,J.D.,But you know everything about me.
249.67,253.12,J.D.,You even know I have them switch Lauren's shifts so we always end up working together.
253.80,254.49,Carla,I didn't know that.
254.55,257.35,J.D.,"Well, you do now because I'm sharing with you."
257.39,258.94,Carla,"Okay, I'm leaving now."
259.66,259.78,J.D.,Wow.
260.53,262.59,Lauren,Another Friday night? That's three in a row.
263.05,264.26,J.D.,"No, it's so unfair."
268.07,269.27,J.D.,I'm mad about it.
269.98,273.72,Turk,"Bonnie is killing me. I'm telling you, I cannot beat this woman no matter what I try."
274.18,275.35,Turk,"She's like a ninja, but worse."
275.75,278.44,J.D.,Nothing's worse than a ninja. They're master of every style of combat.
278.77,280.80,Carla,Can we please talk about something other than Bonnie?
282.69,285.23,Elliot,"I think you should give Bonnie a break. You know, it's really hard being a woman"
285.23,288.60,Elliot,around here. You can walk through walls and nobody notices you.
288.91,291.41,J.D.,Not entirely unlike a ninja.
291.42,292.02,Turk,Whatever.
294.96,296.24,J.D.,"Catch you later, my brother."
297.29,298.29,Turk,I'll holla.
299.52,300.24,J.D.,"He said ""Holla."""
303.46,305.69,Nurse Roberts,Mr Tillman's results are back. It's bad.
306.45,307.45,Dr. Cox,"Damn it, Laverne."
308.14,309.46,Dr. Cox,Why can't I ever be the one dying?
310.46,310.99,Nurse Roberts,I don't know.
311.47,312.77,Dr. Cox,It was rhetorical.
312.85,314.96,Dr. Cox,"If you tell Mrs. Tillman that I'll be right out,"
315.02,316.25,Dr. Cox,that would be just terrific.
316.43,318.57,Elliot,"Dr. Cox, Mr. Tillman is my patient too, you know."
318.81,319.18,Dr. Cox,He is.
319.60,320.81,Elliot,"I was in a room with you this morning, remember?"
321.99,323.41,Dr. Cox,"Uh, no."
325.24,325.80,Elliot,"Well, I was."
326.92,329.15,Elliot,"Anyway, if you want, I could talk to his wife,"
329.49,331.74,Elliot,because I just really enjoy that kind of stuff.
331.84,332.30,Dr. Cox,Wait a minute.
332.90,334.91,Dr. Cox,Are you actually saying you enjoy telling people
334.93,336.24,Dr. Cox,their spouses are going to die?
338.04,340.37,Elliot,"Yep. I mean, I know that sounded a little bit weird,"
340.39,342.10,Elliot,but I just really like being there for people.
342.16,345.09,Elliot,It's kind of why I became a doctor in the first place.
345.81,347.88,Dr. Cox,"Well, it's nice to know where the magic began."
350.19,351.24,Dr. Cox,There you go.
352.41,355.70,Dr. Kelso,"So, how are my girls today? Fantastic."
355.94,356.16,Carla,Listen.
356.34,358.45,Carla,"Dr. Kelso, if you're here to do one of your"
358.49,359.44,Carla,"how are my girls today now,"
359.54,361.31,Carla,"let me tell you some things you don't want to hear routines,"
361.35,362.39,Carla,"I should warn you, I'm in a mood."
363.09,364.48,Carla,So it's probably in your best interest
364.52,366.43,Carla,"to make up some lame excuse, turn around and leave."
366.79,369.25,Dr. Kelso,"Young lady, I will not be spoken to like that."
371.04,373.38,Dr. Kelso,"Luckily for you, I have to go see Mrs. Pfitztuffulla"
373.40,374.42,Dr. Kelso,down in Pfofferoptrics.
375.75,376.60,Carla,Atta boy.
377.75,378.56,J.D.,"Rough day, huh?"
379.66,382.64,J.D.,"Well, maybe it would help to share with someone."
383.74,384.14,Carla,Okay.
385.21,387.27,Carla,You want in? You want me to open up?
388.10,389.18,J.D.,I think I can handle it.
389.64,389.88,Carla,Fine!
391.79,393.91,Carla,I don't like the way I look. I don't like the way I think.
394.13,395.90,Carla,I don't like the way I feel about her right now.
396.38,400.45,Carla,"I have too much hair, my boots are too low, my butt is too big, and I'm too short."
401.31,405.02,Carla,"Plus, when I woke up this morning, I cried for like half an hour because I thought I was getting wrinkles,"
405.08,407.49,Carla,but it turns out I just fell asleep on Turk's corduroy pants.
408.49,408.82,J.D.,Wow.
409.11,411.69,Carla,There. Now you think I'm the craziest woman here.
414.25,416.59,Elliot,Dr. Cox let me tell a woman that her husband's dying.
421.05,421.97,J.D.,"No, I don't."
423.05,430.04,Bonnie,"Huh, so I'm doing a Nissen-Gastric Fundaplication and you're doing yet another appendectomy."
431.00,432.01,Bonnie,How fun for you!
432.91,434.15,Turk,"What did you call that, smack-talk?"
434.85,437.02,Turk,You should have asked me how it feels to be so far below you.
437.04,439.77,Turk,"I wouldn't be able to read ""Suck it, Turk"" if you wrote it on the bottom of your shoe."
442.45,443.79,Bonnie,"Okay, how does that feel?"
444.73,445.01,Turk,Damn.
445.29,450.14,Dr. Kelso,Doctors. Something I've taken great pride in over the years is Sacred Heart's involvement
450.16,452.33,Dr. Kelso,in the Esteemed Doctors Without Borders program.
452.95,456.32,Dr. Kelso,"Now, every year, I single out the most qualified"
456.44,459.99,Dr. Kelso,surgical resident to accompany me to Mexico for a weekend.
460.83,462.63,Dr. Kelso,"Anyway, I've made my decision."
463.48,464.00,Todd,"Thank you, sir."
464.60,466.61,Todd,You haven't lived until you've tasted El Tod's guac.
468.61,469.80,Dr. Kelso,"Dr. Turk, pack your bag."
471.62,472.08,Todd,Dang!
480.79,481.79,Bonnie,"Shove it, Turk!"
483.29,490.84,Turk,I'm gonna shove it and love it and dance around above it hey shove it and love it and dance
490.88,492.46,Turk,around above it come on you see that's what's really bothering me what Turk and Bonnie they
493.43,495.39,Carla,"You see, that's what's really bothering me?"
496.30,497.30,J.D.,"What, Turk and Bonnie?"
497.91,498.91,J.D.,They hate each other.
499.11,501.59,Carla,Then why is he doing his you're so getting a piece of this dance?
501.99,507.06,J.D.,He's not. It's his in-your-face dance. Or it's his there's a sale on lotion dance.
507.08,508.75,J.D.,I don't know he's got so many dances.
508.76,510.44,Carla,Please they might as well be naked.
510.92,511.60,Carla,Slut.
512.75,516.55,J.D.,"Carla, trust me there's no way that he's cheating on you."
516.86,518.39,Carla,Yeah. You're probably right.
520.63,522.80,J.D.,"Wait, that's it? You were just freaking out."
523.06,524.06,Carla,"Hey, you wanted in."
526.25,527.60,J.D.,Crazy
528.87,529.36,Dr. Cox,Barbie.
529.37,530.00,Elliot,Yessie?
531.17,532.44,Dr. Cox,How did it go with Mrs. Tillman?
532.44,534.21,Elliot,It was awesome.
538.10,540.49,Dr. Cox,It's not possessed it's for sitting.
540.88,541.55,Elliot,Excuse me?
541.88,543.67,Dr. Cox,"For God's sake, you must park it."
549.35,551.60,Dr. Cox,"Of course, what we generally do now is eat."
553.38,553.86,Elliot,Eat.
556.57,557.77,Elliot,I can't. I'm too nervous.
562.67,563.33,Dr. Wen,Christopher.
563.83,565.84,Turk,"Sorry, sir. I just can't believe Kelso chose me."
566.46,569.19,Dr. Wen,"Yeah, me neither. I told him to take Bonnie."
569.63,570.69,Turk,So then why did he pick me?
570.91,574.20,Dr. Wen,"Among all the surgery residents, what's the difference between you,"
574.74,577.52,Dr. Wen,"Bonnie, Todd, Steve, Eric and V.J.?"
577.99,578.87,Turk,"First of all, she's a..."
579.08,579.76,Dr. Wen,There it is.
580.58,581.18,Turk,"Wait, because she?"
581.29,581.53,Dr. Wen,Yep.
582.23,582.67,Turk,She?
583.02,584.05,Dr. Wen,Exactly.
585.08,585.46,Turk,Huh?
587.69,589.05,Turk,It's because she's a woman.
590.03,590.67,Turk,Damn!
593.71,594.46,Janitor,Fork!
595.66,596.93,Janitor,We can't eat soup!
599.77,602.09,J.D.,"Look, I don't think you're stupid, okay?"
602.55,604.04,J.D.,Your job requires a lot of know-how.
604.78,607.43,J.D.,"I mean, come on, it's not like you're ladling out sloppy joes or something."
610.77,612.69,J.D.,"You know, my uncle was a joer."
613.01,613.17,J.D.,Yeah.
615.08,616.18,Janitor,"Troy, let me fill you in on this guy."
616.72,617.07,Carla,J.D.!
618.47,619.03,J.D.,"Oh, thank God."
620.81,622.12,J.D.,"A lot happens in the cafeteria,"
623.16,624.81,J.D.,"whether you've accidentally just stolen your lunch,"
625.95,627.69,J.D.,"or you've finally gotten someone to notice you,"
629.10,631.22,J.D.,or you've connected with a friend on a level you didn't know you could.
632.36,634.37,J.D.,The cafeteria is just a happy place.
636.30,637.43,J.D.,What's wrong with him?
637.43,639.84,Turk,The only reason why I'm going to Mexico is because Bonnie's not a guy.
640.90,641.81,Carla,"I'm sorry, baby."
641.87,643.81,Turk,I can't believe you think I got a thing for her.
645.03,645.86,J.D.,"Oh, no."
646.60,647.28,Carla,Who told you that?
659.67,660.65,Carla,J.D. told you that?
661.47,662.77,J.D.,Why did you guys learn sign language?
664.72,665.42,J.D.,Night classes?
666.58,667.75,J.D.,"Wait, when did I learn sign language?"
669.05,670.89,Turk,JD said you're a big old can of crazy.
672.76,673.40,J.D.,A little can.
673.60,675.93,J.D.,"A very tiny, small can."
676.73,677.69,Turk,"No, you said big can."
684.46,686.89,Carla,"Mr. Hogan, I've come up with a little mantra for you."
687.22,687.46,Mr. Hogan,Hit me.
688.24,691.79,Carla,"If meat is your treat, your esophageal varices will bleed into your intestines,"
691.85,694.58,Carla,"causing you to digest your own blood, leading to a horrible, horrible death."
694.96,695.22,Mr. Hogan,Catchy.
695.97,697.31,Carla,Just say it over and over again.
697.67,700.98,Mr. Hogan,"Horrible, horrible death. Horrible, horrible death. Horrible, horrible death."
700.98,702.09,J.D.,"Okay, you can fix this."
702.45,704.45,J.D.,"Carla, look, I messed up, and I'm so sorry."
705.25,707.72,Carla,"Bambi, we're good, okay? We're pals."
707.98,708.49,J.D.,Thank you.
709.12,711.09,Lauren,"So you think it's funny to switch people's shifts, huh?"
711.57,712.01,Carla,"Bye, pal."
713.36,715.10,Lauren,I missed my baby's first steps.
715.76,716.83,J.D.,I'm so sorry.
718.05,719.11,J.D.,Does this mean you're married?
722.93,724.17,Turk,"Dr. Calso, can I borrow these for a second?"
724.17,725.60,Dr. Kelso,"Based on history, I'd say yes."
725.70,727.53,Turk,I know for a fact the doctor wouldn't recommend to Bonnie.
727.67,729.70,Dr. Kelso,"Dr. Turk, I chose you over that nice young lady"
729.70,731.42,Dr. Kelso,because we're going to be moving around a lot
731.44,733.23,Dr. Kelso,and I can't be pulling over every two minutes
733.31,735.89,Dr. Kelso,with pee-pee stops and those nylons that come in plastic eggs.
736.13,738.48,Turk,"Dr. Calso, don't you think that's a little sexist?"
739.22,740.27,Dr. Kelso,"I don't know, sport."
740.89,742.57,Dr. Kelso,Is it sexist to hold the door for a woman?
743.23,746.30,Dr. Kelso,Is it sexist to keep the pretty nurses and unload a few uggos?
746.64,748.71,Dr. Kelso,"The rules have changed so much, I just can't keep up."
750.51,753.17,Dr. Kelso,"Tell you what, let's stop jiggling each other's marbles."
753.92,754.95,Dr. Kelso,You decide who should go.
755.41,756.69,Dr. Kelso,"That way, when you choose yourself,"
756.85,759.20,Dr. Kelso,I won't have to deal with all this horrible guilt.
764.96,765.63,Elliot,Dr. Cox!
766.08,767.08,Dr. Cox,"Aw, geez, Edith!"
767.98,768.39,Elliot,Hey!
770.57,771.69,Elliot,This chair won't pull out.
772.08,772.52,Dr. Cox,Oh.
773.36,776.07,Dr. Cox,Maybe that's because my ankles are wrapped around it.
776.91,779.34,Dr. Cox,"Look, it actually needs some me time."
779.88,780.19,Elliot,Oh.
780.77,781.14,Dr. Cox,Yeah.
781.61,782.02,Elliot,Okay.
787.67,790.08,Elliot,"I just wanted to say that if you had any other bad news situations,"
790.15,791.66,Elliot,I would gladly handle them for you.
792.72,793.11,Dr. Cox,Really?
793.95,794.23,Elliot,Gladly.
797.58,798.38,Dr. Cox,"Well, welcome aboard."
810.21,812.20,J.D.,"Dude, why would you get turkey when there's egg salad?"
812.52,813.61,Turk,"Dude, there's no egg salad today."
819.01,820.16,Janitor,Missed a spot.
826.74,827.92,J.D.,So we're even right?
828.22,828.77,Carla,Even.
829.71,831.61,Carla,I told a nurse you switched her shift.
831.80,835.41,Carla,You babbled all my crazy to the person I plan on spending the rest of my life with.
835.41,840.46,J.D.,"I could've spent the rest of my life with Lauren, or at least with her tushy I just want to wash it is that weird?"
841.20,842.20,Carla,You think this is funny?
842.96,843.75,J.D.,Come on.
843.75,846.57,Carla,I told you how hard it is for me to let my guard down.
846.85,848.55,Carla,"And that quick, you burned me."
850.61,851.25,Carla,Never again.
851.69,852.49,J.D.,"Well, don't walk away."
852.87,854.32,J.D.,"Carla, come on."
858.09,861.05,Turk,"Bonnie, I found out a doctor went and actually recommended"
861.07,862.01,Turk,you for that trip to Mexico.
863.60,865.79,Turk,I'm sure you know how hard it is for me to stand here
865.79,867.10,Turk,"and admit that to you, so I was hoping"
867.13,868.99,Turk,that we can use this as an opportunity to
869.39,871.53,Turk,repair our relationship.
872.73,873.41,Turk,What do you say?
875.49,880.18,Bonnie,Daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
878.54,879.23,Turk,Oh my god.
879.52,880.18,Turk,Okay fine!
880.18,881.60,Turk,"Look, you go to Mexico."
882.04,882.60,Turk,Okay?
883.07,885.30,Turk,"By the way, ""dolor en el asno"" means ""pain in the ass"""
885.58,887.21,Turk,I thought it would help you when you introduce yourself.
888.39,889.89,Bonnie,I don't want your charity.
890.51,890.84,Bonnie,You go.
891.00,892.80,Bonnie,"And every second you are down there,"
892.88,897.13,Bonnie,I want you to think about how I kick your ass up and down these halls all day long.
898.61,899.86,Bonnie,"Now, where was I?"
901.73,902.36,Turk,Daa..
902.59,902.85,Bonnie,Oh yeah!
904.61,905.92,Dr. Cox,"There you go, prom queen."
906.32,909.79,Dr. Cox,"There's some really tragic stuff in there, so, you know, go nuts."
911.51,912.82,Elliot,All of these are your patients?
913.46,916.99,Dr. Cox,"No, but when word got out about your little offer, a bunch of the docs wanted in."
918.01,919.69,Elliot,"Oh, great. More for me."
926.57,927.65,Elliot,I'm afraid you have hepatitis.
930.47,931.47,Elliot,Meningitis?
934.23,935.93,Elliot,Esophageal Gastrodeo-Nocollitis.
937.34,939.52,Elliot,"Yes, it's like being blind in one eye."
941.18,943.19,Elliot,Except you'll be blind in both.
947.23,948.30,Elliot,I'm really sorry. Um...
950.53,951.66,Elliot,There's nothing more that we can do.
955.99,958.99,Janitor,Hello? We can hear you. Hello?
959.96,960.94,Troy,Why won't it stop ringing?
961.27,964.35,Janitor,Hello? Hello again? Hello?
964.57,965.66,J.D.,"All right, look, okay?"
965.66,967.75,J.D.,"I never meant to insinuate you guys were stupid, all right?"
969.13,971.24,J.D.,Everyone knows you're 100 times smarter
971.24,973.22,J.D.,than the jackasses that run this place.
973.22,974.28,Dr. Kelso,"Is that so, sport?"
974.46,976.03,J.D.,"No, sir, it's not so."
978.87,980.96,J.D.,"Would you just go ahead and answer it, already! Hello?"
981.76,982.71,Janitor,Hello?
986.76,988.49,Troy,"Take that, smart guy."
989.23,991.27,Janitor,"Troy, that's not how we do it."
994.62,995.74,Carla,"Mr. Hogan, what the hell?"
996.55,999.19,Mr. Hogan,What would you do if your five-year-old son begged you to have a bite of his dinner?
999.41,1000.74,Carla,You had two dozen ribs.
1001.18,1001.56,Mr. Hogan,I know.
1001.74,1002.69,Mr. Hogan,I don't even have a kid.
1003.67,1003.99,Carla,That's it.
1004.25,1004.81,Carla,I've had enough.
1004.93,1005.70,Carla,This is ridiculous.
1005.91,1008.24,J.D.,"Will you lay off Mr. Hogan? So he made a mistake, all right?"
1008.28,1009.30,J.D.,People make mistakes.
1009.42,1011.65,J.D.,"When they do, it wouldn't hurt you to cut him some slack once in a while."
1011.98,1012.63,Mr. Hogan,Thanks man.
1012.63,1014.12,J.D.,Quiet. This isn't about you. Don't eat meat.
1014.98,1017.73,J.D.,"Carla, look, every time you screwed up with me,"
1017.83,1018.77,J.D.,I've totally let you off the hook.
1019.28,1020.59,Carla,When have I ever screwed up with you?
1021.85,1023.88,J.D.,"Okay, never. But we both know that if you ever did,"
1024.00,1024.66,J.D.,I would give you a break.
1025.86,1027.67,J.D.,"Now, let's see how you like it when I walk away from you."
1031.67,1032.87,J.D.,"Actually, you need to go this way."
1035.64,1036.32,J.D.,Right the first time.
1046.17,1046.47,Elliot,Awesome.
1046.87,1049.56,Dr. Cox,"Aw, you're gonna love this one."
1049.84,1052.21,Dr. Cox,"25-year-old woman. Dancer, actually."
1052.49,1055.38,Dr. Cox,"Well, not anymore. I'm afraid we have to take both of her legs."
1055.50,1059.05,Dr. Cox,Bilateral gangrene. And seeing as her husband recently passed away.
1059.19,1062.36,Dr. Cox,And her insurance at the dancers union probably is not gonna cover it.
1062.40,1065.87,Dr. Cox,You should go ahead and tell her she won't be able to stay here with us for her rehab.
1066.77,1067.11,Elliot,"Um, what?"
1068.36,1069.06,Elliot,room is she in?
1070.04,1071.33,Dr. Cox,There is no room.
1072.19,1076.36,Dr. Cox,"In fact, in the history of medicine, there's never actually been a patient that depressing."
1077.12,1077.59,Dr. Cox,I made her up.
1078.27,1080.02,Dr. Cox,"Come on now, Barbie. You keep going down this road,"
1080.06,1082.34,Dr. Cox,you're gonna go up to the roof of this hospital and jump the hell off.
1083.38,1086.47,Dr. Cox,"Mind you, it's only five stories high, so that means you'll just wind up back down here,"
1086.53,1088.36,Dr. Cox,"where I, of course, will be the one who has to treat you,"
1088.46,1090.35,Dr. Cox,"and then I'll be forced to jump off the roof of this hospital,"
1090.37,1093.11,Dr. Cox,which as I was suggesting to you is only five stories high.
1093.43,1096.50,Dr. Cox,And are you starting to see a pattern forming here?
1097.69,1099.01,Elliot,I just wanted to be colleagues.
1099.93,1102.98,Dr. Cox,"Barbie, as long as you stay and work at this hospital,"
1103.10,1104.40,Dr. Cox,I'm always going to be your superior.
1104.51,1106.37,Dr. Cox,That's just the way it goes.
1107.11,1110.10,Dr. Cox,"Don't get me wrong, you can keep trying to connect with me."
1110.16,1113.43,Dr. Cox,"I mean, hell, you're just a damn entertaining."
1113.47,1114.85,Dr. Cox,You just might make some headway.
1115.47,1117.88,Dr. Cox,"But still, you might be better served."
1117.92,1122.83,Dr. Cox,"And this is a crazy notion, if you could stop worrying so much about who does and doesn't"
1122.87,1124.17,Dr. Cox,notice you.
1125.41,1126.24,Dr. Cox,Even for a second.
1127.61,1128.22,Dr. Cox,That'd be good.
1130.32,1131.13,Dr. Cox,That'd be real good.
1132.40,1134.55,J.D.,I think every day is made up of tiny little tests.
1138.04,1139.07,J.D.,Some are tests of character.
1143.00,1144.57,J.D.,Some are tests of fortitude.
1153.29,1155.07,J.D.,Others are tests of friendship.
1157.01,1158.03,Carla,I spoke to my brother today.
1159.19,1159.45,J.D.,Really?
1160.08,1160.67,Carla,Mm-hmm.
1161.72,1162.77,Carla,He's having some problems.
1163.37,1167.77,J.D.,"And if you're lucky, when it really matters, you'll pass with flying colors."
1170.96,1172.07,Todd,"Hola, K-dog."
1172.99,1173.69,Todd,Yeah!
1174.24,1174.96,Todd,Full bar!
1176.89,1178.29,Todd,Take us to Mexico!
