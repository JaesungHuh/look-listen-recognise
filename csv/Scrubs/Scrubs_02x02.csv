2.92,3.36,J.D.,There.
3.64,5.58,J.D.,Just a tiny splinter.
6.48,13.61,J.D.,"It's funny, I can't stop thinking about Aesop's fables. You know, the one where the lion's always hassling the little mouse, but then the mouse"
13.61,14.71,J.D.,pulls a thorn from his paw?
15.12,17.65,Janitor,"All right, then the lion kills him anyway. Heh heh, yeah."
18.25,18.71,J.D.,"No, he doesn't."
20.30,20.82,Janitor,Trust me.
21.20,22.67,Dr. Cox,"Sandy, what do you say we start our work day?"
22.81,24.69,J.D.,"You know, Sandy isn't necessarily a girl's name."
24.69,25.68,Dr. Cox,It's short for Sandra.
25.68,26.18,J.D.,Clear.
26.54,27.13,Jordan,"Hello, Perry."
27.79,29.45,J.D.,"Oh, God. The ex-wife."
29.45,31.04,Dr. Cox,Jordan. What a coincidence.
31.48,33.91,Dr. Cox,"You were in my dream last night. I can't say for certain,"
34.07,37.72,Dr. Cox,but I was having the flesh torn from my bones by a cross-eyed water snake.
37.90,38.51,Dr. Cox,"You, right?"
38.69,38.89,Jordan,Yes.
38.97,39.17,Dr. Cox,Right?
39.39,39.59,Jordan,Yeah.
39.58,39.99,Dr. Cox,Right?
41.33,42.28,Jordan,"Say, let's play a game."
42.68,45.25,Jordan,"I'll throw out an adjective describing how one of you is in bed,"
45.57,47.30,Jordan,and you guys try to guess who it is.
47.40,48.87,J.D.,"Remember, I had no idea she was your ex at the time."
49.53,50.23,Jordan,"Okay, clumsy."
50.53,51.44,Dr. Cox,"Don't answer that, newbie."
51.46,52.22,J.D.,No worries.
54.64,55.32,Dr. Cox,"Good-bye, Jordan."
55.82,56.50,Dr. Cox,Sandy.
57.97,58.83,Jordan,"Good job, DJ."
59.16,63.61,J.D.,You know it's JD okay? And at least I remember the names of all my sexual partners.
63.77,66.65,Jordan,Well I'm sure that girl from high school and your bunk mate
66.69,70.12,Jordan,from Camp Morningwood are both extremely grateful yeah.
71.57,72.57,J.D.,Camp Meadow Wood.
74.55,75.28,J.D.,I made a lanyard.
75.92,82.72,Singer,"I can't do this all on my own, I know"
83.06,85.32,Singer,that I'm no
85.58,86.58,Singer,Superman
90.45,92.07,Singer,I'm no superman.
95.90,97.19,Singer,I'm no superman.
100.53,102.85,J.D.,"It sounds insensitive, but hospitals can be kind of boring."
103.29,107.22,J.D.,"So if a policeman gets into an accident with the bad guy he's chasing, well, it pumps you up."
107.78,108.77,J.D.,"Okay, move it along, fellas."
108.81,109.71,J.D.,There's nothing to see here.
111.53,111.97,J.D.,I'll be over here.
112.73,115.34,Carla,Officer Burson was admitted with shortness of breath and chest pain.
116.00,118.83,Elliot,"Hey, J.D., do you think anyone else gets as excited over a car accident?"
124.83,125.35,J.D.,Maybe Hank.
126.51,128.31,J.D.,We weren't the only ones psyched to be in the game.
129.64,131.43,Turk,The doctor is in.
132.14,132.74,Turk,Bad guy.
132.90,134.65,Turk,This is why you don't run from the police.
135.67,136.98,Turk,"Baby, are you ready to rock?"
137.14,137.48,Nurse #1,Great.
137.78,140.15,Nurse #1,Another cocky resident that wants to start surgery
140.23,141.82,Nurse #1,before the attending shows up.
142.40,142.78,Turk,I'm sorry.
142.87,145.09,Turk,"I just figured that if we finished here quick enough,"
145.66,147.90,Turk,we might have enough time to pull the stick out of your ass.
148.26,148.78,Turk,What do you say?
151.28,152.07,Dr. Kelso,Perry
152.27,154.14,Dr. Cox,Beelzebub.
154.68,154.97,Dr. Cox,Lackey!
155.43,156.23,Ted,"Hey, Dr. Cox."
156.71,159.30,Dr. Kelso,"I'm being honored tonight by the Board of Trustees,"
159.36,160.93,Dr. Kelso,and they asked me to say a few words.
161.03,161.75,Dr. Cox,"Oh, yawn."
162.19,165.40,Dr. Kelso,"Anyway, I would like you to be the one who introduces me."
165.98,167.27,Dr. Cox,Wow. Seriously?
167.51,167.96,Dr. Kelso,Yeah.
167.97,168.58,Dr. Cox,Not interested.
169.11,170.45,Dr. Kelso,I didn't ask if you were interested.
170.60,173.53,Dr. Cox,"Bob, I deeply dislike you. Honestly, it keeps me up at night."
173.57,176.66,Dr. Kelso,"Well, then use that passion. Put that rage on the page."
176.76,179.17,Dr. Cox,Here's an idea. Why not use Big Chief Flop Sweat here?
181.65,183.03,Dr. Kelso,Ted's not an impressive man.
184.91,186.46,Ted,"Hey, that... Ah, he's right."
187.68,188.61,Dr. Cox,Are you okay?
188.61,190.43,Elliot,"Officer Burson, you have a slight arrhythmia,"
190.43,192.74,Elliot,so Dr. Dorian and I are gonna monitor you very closely.
192.95,195.18,J.D.,"But don't worry. We're on top of it, okay?"
195.52,198.86,J.D.,There's nothing like that feeling of really taking charge of a situation.
198.87,199.53,Dr. Cox,Mary?
199.78,200.32,Dr. Cox,Rhoda.
200.54,201.27,Dr. Cox,"Chart, please."
201.84,202.78,Dr. Cox,What'd I stutter? Give me the chart
203.55,204.27,Dr. Cox,Atta girl.
204.43,204.96,Dr. Cox,Oh
205.43,207.77,Dr. Cox,"Man, I don't like his 0-2 set."
208.63,209.75,Dr. Cox,Grab me a doughnut will you?
210.14,212.25,Elliot,"Oh, you mean like a blood pressure thingy?"
212.72,215.85,Dr. Cox,I mean like a glazed thingy and I like sprinkles on half of it
215.89,220.06,Dr. Cox,So if you can't find a half sprinkle get me all sprinkles and go ahead and just pick half of them off.
221.35,223.31,J.D.,"You know, that was kind of demeaning"
224.55,225.22,Dr. Cox,"You know, you're right"
226.08,229.89,Dr. Cox,Would you do me a favor and apologize to her while you get me some coffee and please be quick
229.99,234.30,Dr. Cox,"Otherwise, I'm just gonna have the manager send over a different waitress go you're done now."
234.65,235.13,Dr. Cox,Yeah.
236.74,239.85,J.D.,The frustrating thing was down in the OR Turk was probably running the show
241.15,244.82,Dr. Rose,"Steady, Dr. Turk. Only about two more hours."
246.43,247.67,Turk,"Can you scratch my nose, please?"
248.55,251.38,Nurse #1,No. I can scratch my nose.
253.26,255.05,Nurse #1,"Oh, that feels good."
262.44,263.03,Turk,Yeah.
263.49,267.92,Dr. Kelso,"Ms. Sullivan, I just want to thank you and the rest of the board for giving me this award."
268.36,272.77,Dr. Kelso,The fact that your first choice passed away last weekend in no way makes it any less special.
273.03,274.60,Jordan,Are you sure? Because it seems like it does.
275.16,278.35,Dr. Cox,"Hey, Bob. As far as the whole intro thing goes,"
278.53,280.84,Dr. Cox,"I've actually gone ahead and given it a great deal of thought,"
280.96,284.49,Dr. Cox,but I'm afraid I'm gonna very politely have to tell you to blow it out your ass.
285.65,287.54,Dr. Kelso,I think we both understand how this works.
287.90,290.93,Dr. Kelso,It's like when my dog Baxter goes winkle on the carpet.
291.15,293.62,Dr. Kelso,He always heads right straight away from the tool ship.
293.76,296.57,Dr. Kelso,But we both know that's where he's gonna spend the night.
297.21,297.83,Jordan,"Charming, story."
298.68,300.28,Dr. Cox,"Yeah. The fact of the matter is,"
300.98,303.38,Dr. Cox,I kind of make it a rule never to get in bed with people
303.44,306.11,Dr. Cox,that I have nothing but contempt for.
307.49,307.77,Dr. Cox,Oh.
310.66,312.50,Jordan,"That feels good, J.D."
314.51,315.74,Dr. Cox,You'll now pay for that.
315.88,317.38,Jordan,"God, I hope so."
319.52,320.74,Elliot,"You guys, we're residents now."
320.78,322.46,Elliot,"We're supposed to have more responsibility, you know?"
322.90,326.20,Turk,I scratched my nose with bad guy's toe.
326.50,327.89,J.D.,I think we just have to accept the fact
327.89,329.74,J.D.,that we're the most underappreciated people at this hospital.
329.80,331.61,Carla,"Oh, Bambi, I really feel for you."
331.61,331.93,J.D.,Thank you.
332.24,332.83,Turk,She doesn't.
333.35,335.42,Carla,"J.D., I spend most of my time here"
335.54,336.61,Carla,getting orders barked at me
336.75,338.55,Carla,by people who take credit from my work
338.63,339.81,Carla,and blame me for their mistakes.
340.36,342.58,Carla,"And all the while, I'm expected to hold a doctor's hand."
343.00,345.65,Carla,You should try trading places with me for one day.
347.77,349.03,J.D.,It's actually not that bad.
349.73,351.84,J.D.,And the lace feels soft against my package.
353.72,354.27,J.D.,Nah.
355.85,358.96,Dr. Cox,"Well, I'm glad we finally had a chance to, uh, talk."
359.16,362.07,Jordan,"You and me both. I mean, I haven't had anyone to talk to lately."
362.38,363.21,Dr. Cox,Okay.
363.57,365.28,Jordan,"But, boy, you sure do talk fast."
365.38,366.29,Dr. Cox,"Ah, bye."
366.45,368.88,Jordan,"Next time we talk, maybe I could finish a sentence or two."
372.47,374.68,Carla,You still like her.
376.22,378.69,Dr. Cox,"Why, because we had a conversation in an empty room?"
379.19,380.18,Carla,That room's not empty.
384.67,385.37,Dr. Cox,"Listen, girlfriend,"
385.49,388.32,Dr. Cox,I don't wanna hear your misguided romantic notions.
388.42,389.02,Dr. Cox,"Cause you see, for me,"
389.88,391.99,Dr. Cox,"sex is a sport, like racquetball."
392.05,393.31,Dr. Cox,"You play hard for half an hour,"
393.46,395.27,Dr. Cox,work up a sweat and hope you don't get hit in the eye.
395.57,396.27,Carla,Say what you want.
396.49,397.51,Carla,I know you care about her.
397.85,400.28,Carla,"In fact, I bet that after you two are done"
400.40,401.81,Carla,playing racquetball or talking
401.89,403.51,Carla,"or whatever you crazy kids are calling it,"
404.01,405.74,Carla,you'd like nothing better than to just lie there
405.78,407.59,Carla,and pass the time by watching her sleep.
408.15,410.83,Dr. Cox,"Carla, it's impossible to actually lie next to Jordan."
411.38,413.20,Dr. Cox,Seems like she sleeps hanging upside down
413.30,416.57,Dr. Cox,from the ceiling wrapped in a cocoon of her own wings.
417.49,417.95,Carla,That's nice.
420.51,422.09,Janitor,"Hey, I thought about what you said,"
422.21,423.31,Janitor,"and you're right, I owe you."
423.54,425.02,Janitor,So I got you a date tonight.
425.71,425.97,J.D.,Who?
426.53,426.91,Janitor,Tim.
429.95,430.74,J.D.,I'm not gay.
431.41,431.75,Janitor,What?
432.57,434.52,Janitor,"Oh, oh, okay, I get it."
434.82,435.50,Janitor,But neither's Tim.
438.99,441.35,J.D.,"Unfortunately, I'm on call tonight, and as weird as this"
441.39,444.30,J.D.,"place is during the day, it's even worse at night."
444.90,446.53,J.D.,"See, that's when all the weirdos come out."
448.09,450.33,J.D.,Like the ER doctor who likes to work nights because he says
450.36,451.04,J.D.,he's up anyway.
451.97,452.64,Er Doctor,"Hey, bro."
454.07,455.65,J.D.,Or the nurse who everyone agrees is just
455.69,456.87,J.D.,a little bit off.
458.74,459.76,J.D.,Or if there's a full moon.
461.42,462.85,Ted,"Hey, this is my band."
463.07,465.15,Ted,We all work in different departments in the hospital.
465.32,466.87,J.D.,"Ted, I know you told me last time that we..."
467.07,467.61,Ted,Legal...
467.79,468.47,Randall,Accounting...
468.67,469.68,Crispin,Shipping and receiving...
470.00,472.74,Roy,"On-site property management, including pest control,"
472.98,475.83,Roy,"nighttime security, non-arboreal gardening services,"
476.09,478.60,Roy,and tenant-related easements and liens.
479.02,479.70,J.D.,"Hey, you got promoted."
479.99,480.80,Roy,It's about time.
479.99,480.80,Randall,It's about time.
480.00,480.80,Ted,It's about time.
480.00,480.80,Crispin,It's about time.
481.43,484.04,Ted,He's been busting his hump around here for six years.
481.43,484.04,Roy,He's been busting his hump around here for six years.
481.43,484.04,Crispin,He's been busting his hump around here for six years.
481.43,484.04,Randall,He's been busting his hump around here for six years.
484.56,484.89,Crispin,Hmm.
484.57,484.89,Randall,Hmm.
484.58,484.89,Roy,Hmm.
484.58,484.89,Ted,Hmm.
486.04,488.03,Ted,Dr. Kelso lets us practice here at night.
488.27,490.60,J.D.,"Oh yeah, I remember the cartoon theme songs."
491.12,492.00,Ted,"No, no, no."
492.67,493.75,Ted,That was lame.
494.67,496.04,Ted,We do prime time now.
499.21,502.41,Roy,"You take the good, you take the bad, you take them both, and"
499.21,502.41,Crispin,"You take the good, you take the bad, you take them both, and"
499.21,502.41,Randall,"You take the good, you take the bad, you take them both, and"
499.21,502.41,Ted,"You take the good, you take the bad, you take them both, and"
502.45,503.38,Ted,there you have them.
502.45,503.38,Crispin,there you have them.
502.45,503.38,Randall,there you have them.
502.45,503.38,Roy,there you have them.
503.62,506.73,Ted,"The facts of life, the facts of life, when's the time you"

506.81,508.33,Randall,got to go and show you're growing?
506.81,508.33,Roy,got to go and show you're growing?
508.38,509.79,Ted,Now you know about
508.38,509.79,Crispin,Now you know about
508.38,509.79,Randall,Now you know about
508.38,509.79,Roy,Now you know about
509.85,511.52,Ted,"the facts of life, the facts of life."
512.08,518.91,Ted,"When the world never seems to be living up to your dreams,"
519.20,521.39,Ted,and suddenly you're finding out the facts of life

529.93,533.05,Ted,"It takes a lot, to get them right."
533.26,535.57,Ted,When you're learning the facts of life
535.15,537.25,Ted,Learning the facts of life
535.15,537.25,Crispin,Learning the facts of life

536.88,538.24,Ted,I'm keep on learning on
538.24,542.16,Ted,learning the facts of life
544.16,546.52,J.D.,"Hey. So, what attendings are stuck here on-call tonight?"
546.73,548.06,Turk,Everyone's at that Kelso thing.
548.05,549.16,Elliot,I think Dr. Cox is on.
549.38,551.88,Carla,"No, he went home, but he said that Carol could cover for him."
552.08,554.98,Turk,Is Carol the one with the really burned butt?
554.97,557.05,J.D.,"Well, I'm Carol, so yes."
557.45,559.37,Elliot,It's disturbing how obsessed you are with your own butt.
559.59,561.22,J.D.,"Oh, come on, you guys are missing the point."
561.28,562.55,J.D.,No one is here tonight but us.
562.71,564.03,J.D.,We are running this hospital.
564.43,565.46,Turk,This is our house.
565.64,566.46,Elliot,We're in charge.
566.58,567.31,J.D.,I love my butt.
568.49,571.22,J.D.,It's amazing how one moment you think you know exactly what you want.
573.45,574.08,Dr. Cox,"Oh, God."
575.81,576.59,Dr. Cox,Come on.
576.67,578.44,J.D.,"And then the next moment, everything changes."
578.66,579.04,Carla,Okay
579.92,586.52,Carla,Elliot the ER doctor knows there's no attending up here. So instead of treating and treating people. He's just admitting everyone. You've got 12 so far
587.50,594.48,Carla,Turk oncology cardiology and pediatrics all need surgical consults plus that phone is for you. It's the clinic
594.48,597.69,Carla,"they, too, know you're on your own. So they're just patching all their night calls right on through and Bambi room"
598.09,598.83,Carla,And Bambi?
599.16,606.44,Carla,201 needs an art line. Room 202 needs re-intubation plus Carol. You're needed an ICU to place a femoral swan under fluoro and Mr. Freed
607.42,609.86,J.D.,I've never actually done one of these unsupervised before.
613.27,617.75,J.D.,And that's when I realized tonight we really were all alone running the hospital.
619.38,624.70,Ted,Charles in charge of our days and our nights
619.38,624.70,Crispin,Charles in charge of our days and our nights
619.38,624.70,Randall,Charles in charge of our days and our nights
619.38,624.70,Roy,Charles in charge of our days and our nights
625.00,630.31,Ted,Charles in charge of our wrongs and our rights
625.00,630.31,Crispin,Charles in charge of our wrongs and our rights
625.00,630.31,Randall,Charles in charge of our wrongs and our rights
625.00,630.31,Roy,Charles in charge of our wrongs and our rights
630.57,632.20,Ted,And I see I want
630.57,632.20,Crispin,And I see I want
630.57,632.20,Randall,And I see I want
630.57,632.20,Roy,And I see I want
632.46,635.87,Ted,I want Charles in charge of me.
632.46,635.87,Crispin,I want Charles in charge of me.
632.46,635.87,Randall,I want Charles in charge of me.
632.46,635.87,Roy,I want Charles in charge of me.
639.11,641.61,J.D.,Luckily someone had the guts to stand up and take charge
641.89,643.90,Carla,"Look, you've all been on call before"
644.06,645.28,Carla,So you don't have a safety net
645.63,647.25,Carla,"Most of the time you don't need one anyway, right?"
649.05,652.72,Carla,Fine. I'll just go tell your patients they're on their own because you're all too scared.
652.78,655.35,J.D.,"No, Carla, I'm a doctor. I should tell them."
656.81,659.38,Elliot,"Come on, peeps. Let's go kick some sick patient ass."
662.11,664.33,J.D.,"That, my friends, is one nerdy honky."
667.67,668.11,Turk,That's two.
671.11,672.13,Jordan,My back hurts.
672.92,675.11,Dr. Cox,"Oh, yeah? Well, my front hurts, so touche."
675.95,677.18,Jordan,"Oh, always a charmer."
677.98,678.24,Jordan,Hi.
679.64,683.39,Dr. Cox,Hi. I'm gonna go ahead and get you a big ice-cold glass of water.
683.92,684.80,Dr. Cox,What do you think of that?
685.86,689.99,Dr. Cox,"Oh, sweet mother of mercy, Carla. You were right. You were so right."
690.13,690.52,Carla,Of course.
690.52,692.06,Dr. Cox,Just exactly what in the hell am I supposed to do now?
692.24,692.74,Carla,Duck.
692.80,694.43,Turk,Who at that damn clinic paged me
694.43,696.86,Turk,"because a patient thinks their tongue is too spongy, huh?"
697.55,700.22,Dr. Cox,No circumstances are you to tell any of them that I'm here.
700.22,703.55,Carla,"Yeah, yeah. Look, why don't you just go home and tell Jordan how you feel?"
704.31,705.58,Dr. Cox,Tell a woman how I feel?
705.90,706.90,Carla,"Well, I guess you could duck."
707.37,710.55,Elliot,"Carla, this is ridiculous. He admitted out of cardiology because he has heartburn."
710.98,711.88,Elliot,I hate ER docs.
711.88,715.21,Dr. Cox,I just don't understand my relationship with Jordan.
715.36,715.74,Carla,Duck.
719.25,720.77,Dr. Cox,Now that's just not funny.
723.01,725.15,J.D.,I don't know why I was scared of placing a femoral swan.
725.73,728.04,J.D.,I guess I just couldn't stop wishing there was someone over my shoulder.
729.54,730.99,J.D.,I was even starting to see things.
732.37,735.38,J.D.,"Okay, Mr. Freed. I think I can do this."
736.00,736.33,Mr. Freed,Hmm?
737.01,738.15,J.D.,I'm gonna need a C-arm in here.
739.55,740.24,Janitor,Want me to knock him out?
741.04,741.83,J.D.,What are you doing in here?
742.31,743.33,Janitor,I owe you. I'm helping you out.
743.65,745.34,J.D.,"This isn't like being a janitor, okay?"
745.34,746.72,J.D.,It's not just something like everybody can do.
747.39,749.73,Janitor,"Oh, so you can do my stuff, but I can't do yours."
750.58,750.89,J.D.,Yes!
751.46,752.21,J.D.,"Okay, hot shot."
752.38,754.73,Janitor,What would you use to get a coffee stain up off a tile floor?
756.19,758.76,J.D.,I don't know. The rough side of a sponge.
761.19,762.07,Janitor,Damn it.
766.63,768.03,Carla,Officer Burson's spiraling a bit.
768.75,771.66,Elliot,His pulmonary edema seems to be secondary to acute mitral regurgitation.
772.16,774.45,Elliot,"If it turns out to be a flail leaflet, he'll need surgery."
774.73,777.48,Turk,"Yeah, but his vitals are so weak, I wouldn't feel confident about taking him to the OR."
778.38,781.13,J.D.,"Ah, the classic Catch-22 between medical and surgical."
781.53,783.52,J.D.,"Bottom line, somebody needs to be decisive."
783.84,784.48,J.D.,"Okay, here's the plan."
786.29,786.75,J.D.,We do nothing.
787.09,787.41,Elliot,Sounds good.
787.58,787.86,Turk,I'm in.
788.12,788.78,Carla,That's inspiring.
790.00,792.17,J.D.,We'll meet back here in a few hours to see if his vitals have improved
796.23,797.03,Turk,"Yeah, this ends now"
798.33,803.88,J.D.,Turk should have known that the worst mistake a doctor can possibly make is setting foot in the hospital's free clinic at night
804.88,807.43,Turk,I don't care if you do shave down there. That's not even a medical issue
808.55,809.55,Turk,But it sure is pretty!
810.75,813.82,Turk,"Ma'am you don't have mono, but you do have halitosis"
814.00,814.42,Turk,Mint?
815.38,817.33,Turk,"Man, three baby Tylenol is actually an underdose"
817.45,818.32,Turk,for a woman your size.
818.95,819.38,Turk,Oh!
820.73,821.93,Turk,"Yes, congratulations."
822.01,823.22,Turk,You are double-jointed.
825.85,827.03,Elliot,"Look, I just thought we'd talk to you up here about it"
827.05,828.22,Elliot,so you could see that we don't have any more beds
828.22,829.48,Elliot,and we really can't handle any more patients.
831.45,831.75,Er Doctor,Okay.
832.43,834.78,Er Doctor,You talk way too fast.
834.78,836.19,Elliot,You can just keep one person downstairs.
836.23,837.29,Elliot,We'd be willing to throw a parade for you.
840.01,841.49,Carla,She needs you to give her a break.
842.37,845.80,Er Doctor,"Oh, well, tell her that we're really swamped."
845.84,846.88,Carla,She can understand you.
846.89,847.89,Elliot,Ahhuh. Yeah.
848.21,850.01,Er Doctor,"Well, then, uh, understand this."
850.89,851.94,Er Doctor,"Chill out, bitty."
856.03,856.69,Dr. Cox,Hey.
857.42,859.55,Jordan,"Hey, didn't you go to get water, like, an hour ago?"
860.50,861.07,Dr. Cox,"More or less, yeah."
861.85,864.60,Dr. Cox,"Hey, Jordan, there's something I really want to say to you."
864.86,866.40,Jordan,But can you say it while I'm drinking water?
866.70,868.03,Jordan,Because I'm really dying of thirst.
868.11,869.92,Dr. Cox,I like you. Again.
871.41,876.64,Dr. Cox,There. You win. You can go ahead and do your victory dance or slaughter a goat or whatever it is you do when you're happy.
877.16,877.80,Jordan,You don't like me.
878.57,879.33,Dr. Cox,I watch you when you sleep.
879.77,881.13,Jordan,"Well, that just gives me the heebie-jeebies."
881.60,884.50,Dr. Cox,I can't stop thinking about putting up with you.
885.74,891.43,Jordan,"Look, this is pointless, angry, shallow sex. Why would you go and ruin something like that?"
892.03,894.84,Dr. Cox,"I'm real sorry, but that's just not enough for me anymore."
895.28,902.96,Jordan,"Sweetie, I have feelings for you too, I do, but unlike you, I have some balls so you don't hear me whining about it."
904.50,914.10,Jordan,"Look, Perry, I can't let you back into my life and watch you personally and professionally sabotage every single chance that you get."
914.30,915.85,Jordan,It's too hard. I can't do it.
916.25,922.48,Dr. Cox,"I've changed. I have. I see you shrink now. I actually see two, to tell you the truth."
923.26,928.17,Dr. Cox,"Good God, what do you want me to do to prove to you that I'm not that guy anymore?"
932.21,935.19,Dr. Kelso,"There you are. Had to make me sweat, didn't you?"
936.34,940.50,Dr. Kelso,"Good for you, buckaroo. Here, I took the liberty of writing out my introduction."
940.64,941.10,Dr. Cox,Huh?
942.20,944.77,Dr. Cox,Bob Kelso is the love of my life.
945.51,946.52,Dr. Kelso,My wife is going to do it.
947.88,949.53,Dr. Cox,"She doesn't even seem to be here, Bob."
949.81,951.74,Dr. Kelso,What are you going to do?
952.90,953.25,Jordan,Lovely.
957.04,957.73,Janitor,You rang.
959.39,959.71,Janitor,Lurch.
960.99,963.63,J.D.,My stethoscope is stuck up there. I need you to get it down for him.
965.54,966.22,Janitor,You put it up there.
967.24,969.17,J.D.,It's really neither here nor there.
971.01,971.35,Janitor,We're even.
971.83,972.27,J.D.,Thank God.
972.51,974.84,Janitor,You could have just asked me to stop hassling you for like a year.
975.16,976.27,J.D.,"Okay, I want that then."
977.07,977.55,Janitor,It's too late.
980.51,982.09,J.D.,But I use those for listening.
985.76,987.86,Bespectacled Nurse,"Oh, they want you upstairs in room."
989.73,990.39,Nurse #1,208.
993.85,995.03,J.D.,His vials are exactly the same.
995.85,997.72,J.D.,There's got to be one attending in this stupid hospital.
998.88,1000.72,Carla,You guys are unbelievable.
1001.46,1001.97,Turk,"Thank you, baby."
1002.19,1002.85,Carla,Not the good kind.
1002.95,1003.25,Turk,I know.
1004.27,1006.14,Carla,"You all claim you want more responsibility,"
1006.66,1008.17,Carla,But you're being outsmarted by a doctor
1008.19,1009.43,Carla,who wears scrubs made out of hemp.
1010.17,1011.76,Carla,You're afraid to stand up to a volunteer
1011.80,1013.09,Carla,who's answering the clinic phones.
1013.49,1015.37,Carla,"And Bambi, did you ever place that femoral swan?"
1016.17,1017.01,J.D.,It's on my to-do list.
1017.46,1018.60,Carla,"Now, I know you're all hoping"
1018.70,1020.57,Carla,Officer Burson's vitals would go up or down
1020.69,1022.19,Carla,"and this decision would be made for you,"
1022.25,1022.86,Carla,but guess what?
1023.56,1024.36,Carla,Nothing's changed.
1025.36,1025.97,Carla,So it's on you.
1027.21,1028.21,J.D.,We all knew what we had to do.
1030.24,1030.50,J.D.,Surgery.
1040.31,1042.84,J.D.,"Sometimes, just making a decision is half the battle."
1046.17,1048.71,Ted,"Gentlemen, we can rebuild him, we have the technology."
1051.06,1053.88,Ted,"We can make him better than he was before, better, stronger, faster."
1060.03,1062.69,Roy,Zin-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n
1064.55,1069.66,Ted,Your zin-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n's could be louder. You guys were fine.
1072.62,1073.91,Dr. Cox,"Good evening, everybody."
1076.16,1077.66,Dr. Cox,Bob Kelso is...
1080.27,1082.64,J.D.,"In moments of truth, we always reveal who we really are."
1085.89,1089.21,Dr. Cox,"Bob Kelso is an awful, awful man."
1097.77,1099.85,Dr. Cox,I'm not joking. He's the devil.
1100.99,1103.01,Dr. Cox,What's wrong with you people?
1103.01,1105.46,Dr. Kelso,"That's great stuff, Perry. Great stuff."
1105.46,1107.23,Dr. Kelso,Is this guy a hooter or what?
1108.43,1110.36,Dr. Kelso,I'll get your ass with this.
1110.38,1111.48,Dr. Cox,"Jor, Jordan?"
1114.24,1115.42,Dr. Kelso,Thank you. Thank you.
1116.33,1118.17,J.D.,Sometimes we're our own worst enemy.
1122.33,1124.11,J.D.,And sometimes we rise to the occasion.
1124.49,1126.00,J.D.,Everything went really well.
1130.14,1136.66,J.D.,"Even though we all know that tomorrow morning, the three of us will go back to being the most unappreciated people in the whole damn hospital."
1138.52,1141.05,Nurse #2,"Hey, what are you doing here? I thought you were off last night."
1141.33,1144.24,Carla,I switched shifts to help some friends out. Have a good one.
1144.42,1145.51,Carla,"Hey guys, wait up!"
1148.53,1150.92,Ted,The new boy in the neighborhood
1151.64,1154.31,Ted,Lives downstairs and it's understood
1155.33,1158.55,Ted,He's there just to take good care of me
1159.54,1161.54,Ted,Like he's one of the family
1159.54,1161.54,Crispin,Like he's one of the family
1159.54,1161.54,Randall,Like he's one of the family
1159.54,1161.54,Roy,Like he's one of the family
1161.53,1162.13,Roy,Charles
1162.13,1167.60,Ted,Charles in charge of our days and our nights
1162.13,1167.60,Crispin,Charles in charge of our days and our nights
1162.13,1167.60,Randall,Charles in charge of our days and our nights
1162.13,1167.60,Roy,Charles in charge of our days and our nights
1168.40,1173.38,Ted,Charles in charge of our wrongs and our rights
1168.40,1173.38,Crispin,Charles in charge of our wrongs and our rights
1168.40,1173.38,Randall,Charles in charge of our wrongs and our rights
1168.40,1173.38,Roy,Charles in charge of our wrongs and our rights
1173.38,1174.40,Dr. Kelso,"Shut the hell up, Ted."
1174.40,1174.94,Dr. Kelso,It's morning.
1175.83,1176.33,Ted,Bye.
