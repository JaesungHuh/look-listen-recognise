3.21,4.99,J.D.,Yesterday seemed like it would be a good day.
5.68,6.64,J.D.,Then it happened.
7.57,8.41,Jordan,"Hey, everyone."
8.73,9.71,Dr. Cox,"Brace yourself there, newbie."
10.53,12.76,Jordan,"Carla, my ex-husband is in love with you."
13.44,15.37,Jordan,"It's true. Ask your boyfriend, he knows."
15.91,17.28,Jordan,He and Perry talk about it all the time.
18.02,18.20,Jordan,Huh.
19.25,21.41,Jordan,"And Bob, when are you gonna tell Perry"
21.47,23.62,Jordan,that that promotion you're making him jump through hoops for?
24.08,25.09,Jordan,was filled months ago!
26.29,27.41,Jordan,Which brings us to Twinkie.
27.99,32.50,Jordan,"If you don't have the courage to tell your colleague, Dr. Dorian that you're still crazy about him"
32.92,36.25,Jordan,I'm gonna go ahead and do it for you cuz that's what friends do. Yeah.
37.19,38.92,Jordan,And finally. Perry.
39.91,43.58,Jordan,You are not gonna believe what happened the first time I met your little protege here.
44.21,44.83,J.D.,No!
46.22,48.61,Jordan,I slept with him and it was good.
49.19,49.41,Jordan,Oh.
50.80,50.96,Jordan,Bye.
51.86,54.41,J.D.,"Call it wishful thinking, but I couldn't shake this feeling"
54.41,57.54,J.D.,"that this was nothing more than a very, very bad dream."
61.29,62.27,Turk,"Good morning, tiger."
62.61,64.34,J.D.,"Of course, I've been wrong before."
64.50,65.99,J.D.,How can you let a woman kick you out of your own bed?
66.21,68.28,Turk,"Baby, why you got to be so cranky in the morning?"
68.44,69.28,J.D.,This is unacceptable.
69.32,70.75,J.D.,You said you were going to sleep head to foot.
71.29,73.90,Turk,"Dude, either way, the naughty bits are still in the middle."
73.92,75.19,J.D.,"Yeah, but with the head to foot alignment,"
75.39,76.59,J.D.,there's no way for them to lock in.
77.09,78.12,Turk,Could you be more homophobic?
78.70,79.83,J.D.,"Ugh, I'm not."
82.35,82.71,J.D.,Ready to go?
85.58,86.68,J.D.,"Morning, boy."
86.89,89.69,Carla,I can't remember the last time I was in this foul a mood.
91.54,92.35,J.D.,"Rowdy, no."
92.80,94.03,Carla,Is that supposed to cheer me up?
94.79,95.57,Carla,Who would laugh at that?
97.03,98.50,Turk,"Yeah, Rowdy, hit that!"
98.78,100.35,Turk,Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
100.93,101.59,Carla,I'm outta here.
102.90,103.23,Turk,Babe!
105.38,108.17,J.D.,"Oh, I hate it that everything's so messed up between all of us, you know?"
108.85,110.96,Turk,"Well, just remember what I said to you this morning in bed."
111.90,114.05,J.D.,I had my shoes on. It would have been impossible to lock in.
115.95,118.30,Turk,"Everything's gonna be fine, okay? Just be cool."
118.48,119.46,J.D.,I'm cool. I'm cool.
120.75,122.05,Troubadour,I can get to sleep
124.08,126.34,Troubadour,I think about the implications
126.76,126.96,J.D.,What?
127.67,128.99,Troubadour,Diving in too deep
130.91,136.18,Troubadour,"And possibly the complications. Especially at night,"
137.35,137.82,Turk,Hey!
137.82,143.09,Troubadour,I worry over situations. I know will be alright.
144.91,147.96,Troubadour,Perhaps it's just imagination
148.58,152.21,Troubadour,Day after day it reappears
153.73,155.13,Turk,"Hey babe, come on, where you going?"
155.28,160.55,Troubadour,Night after night my heartbeat shows the fear
161.49,163.41,Troubadour,Ghost appear
163.60,166.38,Troubadour,And fade away
169.15,171.43,Troubadour,Come back another day
187.62,188.46,J.D.,Just keep it down
189.85,191.30,Troubadour,I can't get to sleep
192.88,195.88,Troubadour,I think about the implications
196.28,199.32,Troubadour,of diving in too deep
199.78,202.46,Troubadour,And possibly the complications.
203.34,205.35,Troubadour,Especially at night
206.63,209.60,Troubadour,I worry over situations that I know
210.12,212.19,Troubadour,I know it will be all right
213.39,216.21,Troubadour,It's just overkill.
217.07,220.49,Troubadour,Day after day it reappears
220.01,220.69,J.D.,Hey Elliot
223.87,228.57,Troubadour,Night after night my heartbeat shows the view.
230.42,234.47,Troubadour,Ghosts appear and fade away.
236.96,245.98,Troubadour,Ghosts appear and fade away.
245.75,246.57,J.D.,Nighty night.
249.57,251.85,J.D.,I just wish one of my relationships could be back to normal.
253.94,257.54,Janitor,Whoa. Looks like someone switched the big boy pants a little too soon.
258.24,261.03,J.D.,"Oh, that's very clever. It looks like I wet myself."
261.27,262.45,J.D.,Do you actually think that that's funny?
265.42,266.13,Janitor,Yeah.
268.07,269.09,J.D.,"Good God, that's cold."
270.83,275.28,Singer,I can't do this all on my own.
276.12,277.02,Singer,I know.
277.83,278.83,Singer,that I'm no
280.69,281.49,Singer,superman
285.36,286.83,Singer,I'm no superman.
290.53,291.53,Singer,I'm no superman.
294.71,296.95,J.D.,Life in a hospital is made up of highs and lows.
297.25,299.64,J.D.,"For instance, my spare pair of scrubs doesn't match,"
299.90,302.07,J.D.,but I put my underwear in the microwave to dry them off
302.25,304.76,J.D.,and they feel good.
305.58,306.63,Nurse Roberts,What are you smiling at?
307.25,308.29,J.D.,"Could I have Mr. Buckley's chart, please?"
308.47,309.01,Nurse Roberts,No problem.
309.24,310.34,Nurse Roberts,"I'll keep it right down there,"
310.82,312.03,Nurse Roberts,and to get it yourself out.
313.69,316.18,Dr. Cox,"You know, Bob, I've been thinking about all the times"
316.26,318.01,Dr. Cox,"that you've manipulated me and toyed with me,"
318.23,321.44,Dr. Cox,"and well, I can't help but recall that children's fable"
321.50,323.18,Dr. Cox,about the race between the tortoise
323.28,324.67,Dr. Cox,and the pain in the ass chief of medicine
324.69,325.65,Dr. Cox,that everybody hates.
326.23,329.28,Dr. Cox,"You see, Bob, the painting-ass chief of medicine that everybody hates"
329.40,332.15,Dr. Cox,"kept running out in front of the tortoise and taunting him,"
332.25,333.09,Dr. Cox,but right at the end...
333.82,336.18,Dr. Cox,"Oh, gosh, I'm sure you remember what happened, Bob."
336.92,340.39,Dr. Cox,"The tortoise bit clean through the chief of medicine's calf muscle,"
340.57,341.60,Dr. Cox,"dragged him to the ground,"
341.68,344.19,Dr. Cox,where he and all the other turtles devoured him alive
344.31,345.79,Dr. Cox,right there on the racetrack.
346.05,346.72,Dr. Cox,"It's a ,"
347.37,349.54,Dr. Cox,"disturbing children's book, Bob, I know"
349.72,352.13,Dr. Cox,but it's one that stuck with me nonetheless.
354.13,356.32,Dr. Kelso,"Buzzy, buzz, buzz."
357.26,357.99,Dr. Kelso,My big pardon?
358.71,361.25,Dr. Kelso,"Oh, that's the sound of all the bees in your bonnet."
361.81,364.32,Dr. Kelso,"And Perry, even though I could give a rat's ass,"
364.42,365.73,Dr. Kelso,I still think it's a pretty sound.
370.51,372.51,J.D.,"And just like that, it was my turn to face the music."
373.61,374.15,J.D.,Steady now.
375.80,376.30,J.D.,Be brave.
377.36,377.76,J.D.,Don't cry.
379.53,380.55,Dr. Cox,Good morning.
380.78,381.47,J.D.,What the hell?
382.28,383.04,Dr. Kelso,Dr. Dorian.
383.93,384.65,Dr. Kelso,"Here you go, wiz-kid."
385.09,386.14,J.D.,"Oh, is that my new nickname?"
386.60,387.59,J.D.,Because I actually thought people
387.59,388.75,J.D.,were going to start calling me that in high school
388.77,389.93,J.D.,when I was in our production of The Wiz.
390.88,392.74,J.D.,It was a sort of the hip version of The Wizard of Oz.
393.34,394.69,J.D.,Nipsey Russell played the Tin Man?
396.03,399.04,J.D.,"Come on and eat on down, eat on down the road."
399.04,399.30,J.D.,Remember that?
399.36,400.71,J.D.,"No, well, anyway, kids can be mean"
400.75,402.25,J.D.,and everyone just started calling me Dorothy.
403.88,404.54,J.D.,High school was hard.
406.56,407.53,Dr. Kelso,"Oh, I'm sorry, Sport."
407.75,408.97,Dr. Kelso,I was thinking about soup.
409.73,412.60,Dr. Kelso,"Now, Mr. Zerbo was initially admitted with a high fever"
412.66,413.76,Dr. Kelso,"and suspected meningitis,"
414.05,416.19,Dr. Kelso,but both the head CT and the lumbar puncture
416.23,416.98,Dr. Kelso,came back negative.
417.48,419.07,J.D.,"Yeah, sir, I'd have a full patient load."
419.15,420.39,J.D.,I don't understand how you could just drop this guy
420.39,422.06,J.D.,in my lap and expect to make him a top priority.
422.26,424.47,Dr. Kelso,You want me to say ta-da so it seems more like a trick?
424.95,427.51,Dr. Kelso,"Mr. Zerbo back there is a major hospital benefactor,"
427.60,429.55,Dr. Kelso,"and by golly, you know it's a lot harder"
429.57,431.29,Dr. Kelso,to write a big fat check if you're dead.
431.73,434.50,J.D.,"Neurology, rheumatology, hematology."
434.56,436.53,J.D.,This guy's been turfed to every service in the hospital.
436.53,437.33,J.D.,No one knows what's wrong with him.
437.34,438.07,J.D.,What do you want me to do?
438.07,439.21,Dr. Kelso,I hope it's navy bean today.
439.86,440.29,J.D.,Dr. Kelso.
440.57,445.44,Dr. Kelso,"Well, gee, sport, I would say you should stop whining, find out what's wrong with him and"
445.64,448.55,Dr. Kelso,Or you can be damn sure I'm going to give you something to whine about.
450.53,451.27,J.D.,"Okay, fine, you know."
451.54,453.00,J.D.,"After all, I'm the whiz kid."
455.91,456.58,Janitor,You're now.
458.99,459.71,Todd,Ladies?
460.41,463.38,Todd,"Now that the Todd is a resident, he wants to clear things up so you don't have"
463.38,464.34,Todd,to wonder anymore.
464.95,467.44,Todd,"Yes, yes, no, yes, no."
467.44,469.36,Todd,"And yes, if I've been drinking."
469.79,470.79,Nurse Roberts,"Come here, wonderbread."
471.11,471.85,Todd,What's up doll?
472.76,475.13,Nurse Roberts,"If you ever get this close again, I will end you."
475.48,477.75,Todd,"I'm changing you to a ""yes"" because you're feisty!"
479.62,480.68,Turk,Carl I'm sorry.
480.82,482.18,Carla,For him? Not your fault.
483.46,485.61,Turk,"No, I'm talking about us. I'm sorry for what I did wrong."
486.18,487.00,Carla,Which was?
488.07,488.79,Turk,You know.
488.79,490.99,Carla,"See, you don't even realize why I'm upset. That's"
491.73,492.54,Carla,Why are you smiling?
492.52,494.39,Turk,Because I set your ass up!
495.36,499.75,Turk,Baby. I should have told you how Cox felt about you and I was wrong for talking
499.79,503.78,Turk,behind your back which is a violation of the trust our relationship is based on
504.14,505.46,Turk,and that is why I'm sorry.
505.46,507.50,Todd,My boy's got mad apologizing skills!
507.51,508.51,Turk,"Todd, not now!"
509.75,514.32,Carla,You can't just point out the obvious you have to go deeper. And Todd if you say that's what
514.32,515.55,Carla,she said I will brain you.
516.98,518.02,Carla,"Now, come on baby."
518.53,519.36,Carla,Connect with me.
519.93,521.25,Carla,Why am I really upset?
522.88,524.90,Turk,I'm gonna stick with the violation of trust as final answer.
526.71,527.01,Turk,Heh.
528.55,529.02,Carla,"Yeah, right."
529.98,530.46,Todd,Oh.
533.11,534.58,Todd,"You know, I got half a mind to ask her out."
536.40,536.72,Todd,Too soon?
541.45,543.94,J.D.,"Well, thanks for the loaners, Chet."
544.16,544.94,Chet,Don't stain them.
546.18,548.25,J.D.,"Once you're a resident here, you get a decent locker."
548.87,551.12,J.D.,"Still, it's a co-ed room, so if you need to change..."
553.65,554.39,J.D.,...you do it fast.
554.79,556.60,J.D.,"Dude, that was like some sort of record or something."
558.81,560.88,Elliot,"Sorry, Mom, it's just, it's gotten really awkward"
560.90,562.17,Elliot,with this guy that I was seeing and...
563.61,565.72,Elliot,"Yes, Mom, yay, I'm straight."
565.94,567.15,Elliot,"Look, I just, I don't know what to do."
567.31,569.66,Elliot,"I mean, every time I see him, I get so embarrassed"
569.72,573.10,Elliot,and lonely and mortified
573.12,574.45,Elliot,and I guess I was just hoping that you could...
576.85,579.15,Elliot,"Um, about a hundred and fifteen pounds."
581.20,582.54,Elliot,"Phen-fen kills people, mom!"
584.60,587.05,Elliot,"Because I'm a doctor, that's how I know."
589.37,590.07,Dr. Cox,You look pretty today.
590.15,591.03,Carla,Don't even start with me.
591.13,591.72,Dr. Cox,You look horrible.
592.52,593.48,Carla,I look fantastic.
593.60,595.07,Carla,"And what you're doing, that's starting."
595.17,596.91,Carla,"I'm pretty sure I said not to start, Laverne."
597.31,598.01,Nurse Roberts,That's what she said.
598.18,599.74,Carla,I say 'no empieces' okay?
602.69,604.37,Dr. Cox,"It's ""don't start"" in Spanish."
605.03,605.30,Nurse Roberts,Bueno.
605.66,607.51,J.D.,"I had planned to avoid Dr. Cox all day,"
607.83,609.41,J.D.,"but unfortunately, I needed his help."
609.84,611.72,J.D.,"Dr. Cox, I have this patient, Mr. Zerbo."
611.86,612.30,J.D.,I can't quite...
613.01,613.45,J.D.,Who knows?
613.65,615.89,J.D.,Maybe he just decided to let the whole ex-wife thing go.
616.10,617.16,Dr. Cox,Autoimmune serologies?
617.52,617.92,J.D.,All negative.
618.48,621.15,J.D.,"Then again, maybe he's just letting me stew for a while."
621.33,622.08,J.D.,Bone marrow biopsy.
622.88,623.16,J.D.,Negative.
623.44,625.59,J.D.,What kind of man tortures people like this?
625.97,627.05,Dr. Cox,Afraid you got yourself a toughie.
628.51,630.16,J.D.,"Okay, fine. I'm sorry I slept with your ex-wife."
637.44,639.17,Nurse Roberts,I think I'll sit back down.
640.53,641.52,J.D.,It was an accident.
641.72,642.33,Dr. Cox,Look.
642.91,647.55,Dr. Cox,"First of all, it's not like you tripped and fell into her, then out of her, and then into her again."
648.63,651.40,Dr. Cox,"And second of all, you're smart enough to know that I don't want to talk about this."
651.52,655.05,Dr. Cox,I don't want to know where you did it. I don't even want to know how it was.
655.63,656.20,J.D.,A little scary.
656.44,657.20,J.D.,"Sorry, jitters."
657.88,659.09,J.D.,And here come the fireworks.
660.25,660.53,Dr. Cox,Lookit.
662.38,664.34,Dr. Cox,"I know you didn't have any idea who she was,"
664.40,666.57,Dr. Cox,and I understand why you were too nervous to tell me.
666.69,667.89,Dr. Cox,So what do you say we leave it at that?
668.57,670.26,Dr. Cox,I forgive you. You are forgiven.
670.88,671.10,Dr. Cox,Okay?
672.87,673.25,J.D.,Cool.
674.55,674.99,Nurse Roberts,Damn.
677.01,678.47,J.D.,Hospitals aren't as big as you think.
678.99,680.62,J.D.,"Eventually, you run into everyone."
681.68,682.49,J.D.,"Hey, Elliot."
683.83,687.51,Elliot,I'm not I'm not hiding um I just I was just looking for my um you know that
688.98,690.51,Elliot,I was looking for my dignity
691.73,692.37,J.D.,Did you find it?
693.18,693.69,Elliot,No.
696.52,698.02,Elliot,I must have left at a college.
698.67,700.60,J.D.,Oh for God's sakes. Would you throw her a rope?
701.61,707.90,J.D.,"I have no idea how to treat this patient. Help me out now. She's in a really awkward place, so just be sensitive"
708.66,709.92,J.D.,I think we should sex each other.
710.24,710.99,Elliot,I'm sorry?
710.99,717.40,J.D.,Just hear me out. Our relationship ended so quickly maybe too quickly you know and now there's like these these
717.52,721.25,J.D.,feelings floating around and I feel like we're always gonna regret it if we don't
722.15,723.30,J.D.,see if they lead somewhere.
725.46,726.46,J.D.,What do you think?
727.32,729.72,J.D.,I can't believe how weird it feels to be back here again.
730.07,730.58,Turk,Yeah.
731.47,732.88,Turk,But it seems so right.
734.17,737.14,J.D.,"If Carla's so mad, I don't understand why she doesn't just crash at her own place."
737.61,738.89,Turk,"Oh, she is back at her place."
740.01,741.52,J.D.,What are you talking about Willis?
741.84,742.60,Turk,That's pretty funny.
743.28,744.39,Turk,We should make that one of our things.
745.95,746.63,Carla,That's stupid.
748.62,750.78,Turk,I think I'd really panic if she went back to her place.
752.88,754.33,Turk,"JD, this sucks."
754.73,756.08,J.D.,"Yeah, you know what's weird, though?"
756.53,758.74,J.D.,It's like Dr. Cox and I are pretty vegan-kosher.
759.68,760.39,Turk,You haven't yelled at you?
761.07,761.13,J.D.,No.
761.53,763.60,Turk,This is a guy that screamed on you for like 20 minutes
763.60,764.60,Turk,for dropping a thermometer.
765.06,767.91,Turk,And he hasn't raised his voice once about you bumping uglies with his ex-wife?
768.17,768.49,J.D.,Uh-uh.
770.00,770.74,Turk,I don't get that guy.
772.61,773.77,J.D.,And that's when I realized something.
776.16,777.57,Dr. Cox,"Hey, where you been? I paged you twice."
778.47,779.92,J.D.,I must have misplaced my pager.
780.42,782.63,J.D.,The reason Dr. Cox wasn't yelling at me like he used to.
783.07,785.36,Dr. Cox,Huh. Probably ought to try to find that.
787.87,789.01,J.D.,He didn't care about me anymore.
792.72,794.14,Janitor,"Yep, that's a leaky O-ring."
794.90,798.04,Janitor,"I can fix her, but I've got the parts in stock."
798.66,799.97,Janitor,We need an O-ring down there.
800.91,803.18,Janitor,Ha-ha-ha-ha! That's entertainment!
810.25,812.98,J.D.,"Standing there, I couldn't help thinking about the way things used to be."
813.92,815.10,Dr. Cox,"Don't forget, Felicia!"
815.34,815.88,Dr. Cox,If you...
816.08,818.86,Dr. Cox,If you want to call me a bitch!
821.95,824.35,Dr. Kelso,"Son, you know you really ought to buy that thing dinner first."
829.21,831.55,J.D.,And it wasn't just me and Dr. Cox who weren't getting along.
833.36,835.64,J.D.,Everyone was just drifting through the halls.
835.88,838.03,J.D.,Each one of us acting like the others didn't exist.
841.75,844.72,J.D.,"That's when I decided to get proactive, and I knew just where to start."
845.48,846.79,J.D.,What the bejeesus?
847.27,847.83,Todd,"Hello, boys."
848.35,849.15,J.D.,What the hell are you doing?
850.02,851.79,Todd,This is how the Todd gets his self-esteem on.
853.49,854.09,J.D.,Do these help?
855.29,855.82,Todd,Uncool!
856.74,858.25,Todd,"You look totally hot, Mirror Todd."
862.75,863.14,J.D.,Hey.
865.09,865.49,Elliot,Hey.
866.38,868.83,J.D.,"You know, Elliot, I think we should talk about the sexual tension."
868.87,870.17,Elliot,"There is no sexual tension, okay?"
873.25,874.79,Elliot,Just go ahead and look before your neck snaps.
877.17,877.71,J.D.,Awesome.
879.03,880.30,Elliot,J.D. The problem is this place.
880.74,882.33,Elliot,"You know, we broke up. I had to see you the next day."
883.03,883.63,Elliot,And the next day.
884.28,886.50,Elliot,"You know, I never got any distance from the relationship."
886.58,888.39,Elliot,"I never got to move on, you know?"
889.05,890.19,J.D.,And the sexual tension.
890.69,893.18,Elliot,"Oh, my God, you have no idea what you sound like, do you?"
898.27,899.47,Todd,"J.D.! J.D., check it!"
901.12,901.54,Todd,Rattail!
904.33,905.07,Todd,You don't wanna play?
907.35,908.63,J.D.,Ha! Too slow!
909.27,911.19,J.D.,"What now, Mr. Smart guy?"
914.21,915.03,J.D.,That is so not funny.
917.50,918.14,Dr. Kelso,Wet butt.
919.85,920.19,Janitor,It gets better.
921.17,921.97,J.D.,Is it starting to burn?
922.36,923.14,Janitor,I would think so.
924.34,925.69,Janitor,"Hey, uh, don't touch your eyes."
928.29,929.67,J.D.,"Okay, right back on the horse."
930.13,931.78,J.D.,"First off, I'd like to thank you all for agreeing to talk."
931.88,933.03,Carla,"Bambi, you paged us here."
933.15,935.01,J.D.,"Be that as it may, I think there are some simple solutions."
935.29,936.58,J.D.,"Dr. Cox, you're angry with me."
936.84,937.12,Dr. Cox,"No, I'm not."
937.24,938.71,J.D.,"And you won't admit this, but you're in love with Carla."
938.79,939.37,Carla,"No, he's not."
939.65,940.49,Dr. Cox,"Actually, I am."
940.67,941.46,Carla,You're starting again.
941.48,943.67,J.D.,"And Carla, you're mad that Turk didn't trust you enough to tell you."
944.03,945.21,Turk,"See, trust, woman, trust."
945.29,946.66,J.D.,"Whatever, the point is that Turk is sorry."
946.66,947.50,Turk,Not anymore.
947.50,949.05,Carla,I can't believe you thought he was a threat.
949.17,949.51,Dr. Cox,I'm a threat.
949.77,950.70,Carla,You're not in love with me.
950.76,951.58,Carla,You idealize me.
951.58,952.97,J.D.,Can we just try and stay focused
953.07,954.49,Turk,You mad because I'm scared of losing you?
954.62,956.26,Carla,"Yes, because we're stronger than that."
956.52,957.48,Dr. Cox,Apparently not.
959.05,960.83,Turk,"You should be glad I never took our relationship for granted,"
960.85,961.41,Turk,you silly woman.
961.54,962.79,J.D.,If we could just refrain from name-calling.
962.89,963.83,Dr. Cox,Oprah's right.
964.29,964.87,Turk,Lay off of them.
965.05,965.90,Carla,You're just pissed because you're
965.92,966.72,Carla,still in love with your ex.
966.82,967.19,Dr. Cox,OK.
967.55,967.95,Dr. Cox,That's it.
969.03,970.48,Dr. Cox,"Now, I have killed for so much less than that,"
970.50,972.04,Dr. Cox,and I'll damn sure do it again unless you all
972.10,973.02,Dr. Cox,shut the hell up right now.
973.79,974.43,Dr. Cox,I mean now!
980.55,981.61,J.D.,Aren't you glad we did this?
982.05,983.46,Turk,I'm going out for Mexican food tonight.
983.96,985.51,Turk,"And I'll see you in bed, my friend."
989.59,990.17,J.D.,"Oh my god, Rounds."
991.85,994.46,J.D.,Rounds started five minutes ago and I totally forgot about Mr. Zerbo.
994.60,996.41,J.D.,"Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god."
999.63,1001.41,Nurse Roberts,Are you planning on making this worth my while?
1002.97,1003.50,J.D.,Ow!
1005.64,1011.38,Dr. Kelso,"Dr. Dorian, how about you step up to the mic and tell the entire gang how you ended up treating Mr. Zerbo?"
1011.94,1013.17,J.D.,"Think Wizkid, think!"
1015.21,1015.83,J.D.,"Ah, the hell with it."
1017.20,1017.90,J.D.,"Sir, I did nothing."
1022.01,1023.97,Car Driver,Is this because of the same kid as before?
1027.03,1028.46,Dr. Kelso,You did nothing?
1028.87,1029.88,J.D.,Nothing at all.
1035.13,1036.17,Dr. Kelso,"Great job, sport."
1036.75,1036.91,J.D.,Huh?
1037.73,1040.00,Dr. Kelso,"Whenever a patient gets bounced from ward to ward,"
1040.04,1042.31,Dr. Kelso,there's always a chance a high fever could be sustained
1042.37,1045.64,Dr. Kelso,or even caused by the constant stream of different antibiotics.
1045.90,1046.80,Dr. Kelso,It's called drug fever.
1047.67,1049.41,Dr. Kelso,And it's a good catch by Dr. Dorian.
1050.83,1052.60,Dr. Kelso,"Next patient. Mush, people. Mush!"
1052.80,1054.81,Dr. Kelso,Hah! Hah! Hah!
1057.31,1057.91,Mr. Zerbo,"Thank you, Doctor."
1059.65,1061.32,J.D.,"Oh, no problem. It's funny."
1061.96,1063.57,J.D.,"I guess sometimes when you do nothing at all,"
1063.89,1066.30,J.D.,things just have a way of fixing themselves.
1071.36,1071.99,Dr. Cox,Hey.
1072.92,1074.41,Troubadour,The look between the sheets
1076.72,1078.53,Troubadour,Only brings exasperation
1079.80,1081.61,Troubadour,"It's time to walk the streets,"
1083.37,1085.57,Troubadour,smell the desperation.
1086.44,1089.05,Troubadour,"At least there's pretty lights,"
1090.19,1092.83,Troubadour,though there's little variation.
1093.64,1095.82,Troubadour,It nullifies the night
1097.04,1098.41,Troubadour,from overkill
1100.86,1104.94,Troubadour,Day after day it reappears.
1107.74,1112.45,Troubadour,Night after night my heartbeat shows the fear
1113.41,1118.38,Troubadour,Ghosts appear and fade away
1121.69,1123.47,Troubadour,Come back another day
1131.08,1131.88,Dr. Cox,That'll do it.
1133.37,1134.13,Troubadour,I have other songs.
1134.38,1134.96,Dr. Cox,"Yeah, you do."
1137.17,1139.53,Dr. Cox,"Do you know how I know that this is yours, Farrah?"
1140.26,1143.08,Dr. Cox,"When I paged you earlier, someone found it next to a can of Fresca"
1143.20,1145.49,Dr. Cox,and a dog-eared copy of Teen People magazine.
1145.73,1149.22,Dr. Cox,"Anyway, long story short, the whole incident gave me a bang-up idea"
1149.28,1151.15,Dr. Cox,"because, you see, I've got tomorrow off,"
1151.51,1153.74,Dr. Cox,so I'm gonna be on my couch sipping on some scotch
1153.82,1155.41,Dr. Cox,"and paging you every 20 seconds,"
1155.45,1157.18,Dr. Cox,"and if you don't answer every damn last one of them,"
1157.20,1158.87,Dr. Cox,I'm gonna shove this thing so far down your throat
1158.87,1160.75,Dr. Cox,it's gonna make you take a tinkle every time it goes off.
1163.02,1164.13,Dr. Cox,"Big fun, right?"
1164.94,1166.02,Dr. Cox,You're gonna need this.
1166.43,1169.38,Dr. Cox,"Oh, oh, let it come, let it, oh, let it come."
1169.48,1170.58,Dr. Cox,Whoa-ho-ho-ho-ho.
1173.21,1174.87,J.D.,"Ah, it's good to be home."
1176.76,1177.96,J.D.,"Um, sort of."
